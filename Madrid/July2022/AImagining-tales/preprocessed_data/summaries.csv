An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,10,0,"Hume begins this section by recognizing the positive effect that happy, cheerful company has on us: it's normal to have down days, but Hume observes that good-humored companionship can lift the spirits. Another important quality is self-esteem, as, in Hume's view, it's hard to have respect for others if we don't value ourselves."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,10,1,"Courage is another quality that we often see as a positive thing; partly because it can be useful but also because it has a noble quality that appeals to us. Regardless of the positive results of a hero's actions, there's something about the hero that draws us in—it's that x-factor and doesn't just apply to real life but to characters in literature and art too."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,10,2,"As with the other characteristics featured in this enquiry, courage has been especially valued in certain settings."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,10,3,"Here, Hume refers to places that haven't been fully civilized and don't have the same justice systems that we do."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,10,4,"Even so, Hume recognizes that bravery can reach a point where it gets brutal and destructive—just look at the classic MTV showJackass."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,10,5,"Hume lists philosophical tranquillity as another virtue that inspires our admiration. Guys like Socrates, who maintain a state of serenity and contentment, seem to exist on another level to us average Joes. This kind of state may not be achievable for most of us, but the nearer we get to it, the better."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,10,6,"Once again, Hume highlights that different characteristics can be valued in different times/settings. In ancient times, the heroes of philosophy and war had a grandeur and strength that, to us, can seem kind of extreme."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,10,7,"However, for these ancients, the degree to which moderation and order are valued in the modern world would seem equally incredible."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,10,8,"Returning to the topic of benevolence, Hume reaffirms that it's useful to society. However, he recognizes that it's not just about usefulness. Take the poetic image of the Elysian Fields: the inhabitants of this idyllic place don't need each other's help but still enjoy love and friendship. This then transmits a pleasing image to us."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,10,9,"Some sentiments can be harmful when taken to excess, yet there are other times when heightened sentiments can seem noble or appealing. Hume uses Henry IV of France as an example: this guy's passions and attachments often hurt his cause, but those who sympathize with him may find his weaknesses endearing. As human beings, it's natural for us to be drawn to particular characteristics even if they aren't backed up by reason."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,10,10,"Poetry excites all kinds of passions, but Hume argues that it's the more lofty or gentle affections that are most engaging. This is because they please us on more than one level and cause us to feel respect and affection for the featured characters. As for poets themselves, this ability to move the emotions is a major talent and is all the more valued given its rarity."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,10,11,"Hume finishes this section by recapping that utility isn't always the only source of value—in some cases, we value sentiments for the immediate pleasure that they provide rather than usefulness or future benefits. Still, whether something is valued for usefulness or pleasure, our judgment is based on sympathy."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,11,0,"Up to this point, Hume has focused on qualities that are useful to society or useful/agreeable to the individual."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,11,1,"Now, he turns his attention to virtues that produce a more immediate type of pleasure. In the same way that we have laws of justice, we have a code of manners that affects how we act."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,11,2,"Politeness and good manners are obvious examples, but cleverness and wit also play a role in deciding whether someone's good company. The weight given to these virtues can, however, vary from one country to another."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,11,3,"Hume observes that, among the French, politeness and wit are highly valued, whereas in England people care more about whether someone's sensible and good-natured."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,11,4,"Though lively dialogue is agreeable, folks can get annoyed if someone hogs the conversation. Telling harmless lies in order to please and entertain is generally less appealing than keepin' it real. However, when a person is telling funny stories, fiction can be entertaining."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,11,5,"Being articulate, a genius, or having really good sense and sound reasoning are all pleasing qualities. Modesty is another attribute, one reason being that a modest person is humble, obedient, and open to instruction. Hume goes on to explain that folks generally tend to overvalue rather than undervalue themselves, so modesty keeps this in check. There are some occasions where people are suffering under oppression and pride becomes admirable. In everyday life, though, we need a healthy dose of modesty."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,11,6,"Some of the other qualities that Hume cites as being agreeable are cleanliness, alertness, and decency—we certainly can't argue with that. Hume defines decency as behaving in a way that's appropriate for our position in the world. For instance, some things are approved/disapproved of depending on how old a person is or whether they're male or female."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,11,7,"As well as qualities that can be easily summed up, some people can have a certain appeal that's hard to pin down."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,11,8,"This is most obvious in romantic relationships but it's a mysterious quality that some individuals possess. C'mon, do we really need to put a label on everything?"
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,11,9,"Hume ends by summarizing that, even where we don't know a person or have any share in their success/failure, we still appreciate characteristics such as politeness, modesty, decency, and wit."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,8,0,"The extent to which we see a quality or habit as positive/negative depends, in large part, on usefulness. Things that have a harmful effect on a person or their ability to contribute to society are seen as bad, while qualities that seem well-suited to their purpose (and not excessive/lacking) are fantabulous."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,8,1,"Unlike those philosophers who've seen benevolence as rooted in selfishness, Hume argues that it's based on sympathy and humanity. Get with the program, people!"
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,8,2,"Hume recognizes that some people are more kind than others and briefly toys with the idea of a person who doesn't care at all. However, he doesn't dwell on this and instead focuses on the role that usefulness plays in shaping our views and actions."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,8,3,"It's all about good judgment: we think about a situation and weigh the best course of action. Heard of the tortoise and the hare? Well, Hume sees this as a prime example."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,8,4,"Hume argues that we need to be sensible and think about the future rather than being greedy, pleasure-seeking, or squandering cash. Qualities such as honesty and loyalty are obviously important in promoting the interests of society but they're beneficial to the individual, too. The ideal is for a person to think about their duty to themselves and to society."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,8,5,"Though some virtues are equally valued in men and women, chastity/purity is seen as way more vital for women."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,8,6,"Hume explains that there are so many chances for women to give into temptation that nothing less than complete modesty is acceptable. For a man, it's easier to recover after he's made a mistake. If a woman makes a mistake, however, she's exposed to all kinds of insults and loses her social rank. Equality? Not so much."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,8,7,"We all want to be happy campers; however, it's not always easy to think of the long-term in the face of temptations that are right in front of us. Hume therefore warns against giving into temptation, arguing that we should keep in mind our future goals and stick to our guns. Is it just us, or would this guy make a great advice columnist? Better watch out, Abby."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,8,8,"In Hume's view, one of the reasons why the fool is looked on negatively (unlike the wise man) is that they don't have any use to society. This shows just how much usefulness is valued. Still, Hume states that some qualities can be valued because of their rarity and nobility even where they're not useful."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,8,9,"What's seen as useful can vary over time. For example, memory was valued in the ancient times more than it is now, as this was a time when public speakers were held in highest regard and expected to put on a good show."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,8,10,"Sometimes, when people boast about their virtues, we might find ourselves feeling cynical. Moral virtues like benevolence or public spirit can seem insincere in some cases, and we start to think ""yeah right."" However, Hume maintains that we never lose our sense of moral judgment altogether."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,8,11,"In conclusion, Hume argues that we're never totally indifferent to the happiness or misery of others. We start out by recognizing merits that are beneficial to the person that possesses them, and this then shapes our thinking on a wider scale. The result? We're able to view the world through the lens of ""disinterested benevolence"" (AII.12)."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,9,0,"So far, Hume has focused mostly on mental and emotional characteristics. However, can we apply the same logic to physical characteristics? Hume thinks so."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,9,1,"We tend to have a positive impression of features that suggest health, fitness, and vitality, but we need, in addition, to consider whether a person's suited to the situation at hand. Hume observes, for example, that strength and agility were of major value in ancient times due to their usefulness in war. A similar mindset shapes our reactions to painting and statues, where proper balance is pleasing to us."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,9,2,"Hume then refers to ""barrenness"" (infertility) in women as another type of inutility and, likewise, impotence (the inability to engage in sexual relations) as a defect that robs people of pleasure."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,9,3,"Health in general is highly valued, but Hume notes that temporary ill health doesn't automatically single anyone out as useless—we're not that ruthless. It's when we compare ourselves to superior species that we become aware of how vulnerable we are."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,9,4,"The next subject that Hume tackles is why we admire those who are rich and powerful. His conclusion is that this stems from images of happiness, success, comfort, etc. We may sometimes feel envy, but this goes alongside respect and humility; likewise, we may feel pity for those less fortunate."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,9,5,"Hume makes the further point that folks may put personal characteristics above fame and fortune. On the surface, though, they may pay more attention to the signs of riches since these flag someone's social position. Maybe we're all a little bit shallow after all."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,9,6,"As Hume has said before, which characteristics are commonly valued can depend on the place and the time period. So, where a person's current state of wealth is most important in England, noble ancestry is a bigger deal in Europe."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,9,7,"Hume doesn't argue that one is better. His point is that power and riches generally inspire respect, and those who live comfortably give off a sense of prosperity and satisfaction."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,2,0,"This section begins with Hume setting out his idea of the ideal moral citizen. In both their private life and public life, this individual is caring, reliable, and fair. Likewise, if they hold a position of authority, they're a thoughtful and compassionate leader rather than a boss from hell. This isn't just about niceness, but usefulness too."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,2,1,"To illustrate this, Hume points out that we sometimes talk about the usefulness of plants or animals: when we see fields full of corn or cows grazing, we know that they're not just part of the scenery but have a purpose. Similarly, we might notice whether or not a machine, a house, or a piece of furniture is suited to its purpose. Speaking of which, check out this couch—ouch!"
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,2,2,"Hume emphasizes that usefulness isn't limited to certain jobs. For sure, it's important when we're talking about manufacturing items that are necessary or helpful to us, but Hume points out that a monk would be irked if we suggested that his order was useless or harmful. Equally, writers cares about the responses to their work."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,2,3,"Hume gives a bunch of other examples. For instance, he notes cases where utility—or lack of—has been used as the basis of praising or slamming religion. His overall argument is that morality is mostly based on usefulness to the public."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,2,4,"If we first overlook this or if we first think something's useful only to find out otherwise, this causes us to readjust our views. So, if we give money to someone thinking that we're helping them, only to find out that they've blown it, we're not exactly gonna be jumping for joy."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,2,5,"People's ideas about the public good have sometimes changed over time: Hume notes that assassinating cruel princes was celebrated in ancient times but folks realized that this doesn't work out well in the long term. Hume adds that we may applaud princes for acts of generosity but that, if the receivers squander the cash or get greedy, we start to get hacked off."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,2,6,"Hume isn't down on luxury, though he recognizes that it can have its pitfalls. He explains that luxury has often been associated with corruption, civil wars, and oppression, and has been seen as immoral. However, if we think of it as leading to an increase of things that are beneficial to humankind (like industry and the arts), we see that it's not all bad."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,2,7,"Hume rounds off by emphasizing the importance of benevolence, describing this as a social virtue that's useful in securing people's happiness and wellbeing. Yep, Ebenezer Scrooge learnt a valuable lesson."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,3,0,"To demonstrate the role of justice, Hume paints a picture of a world in which everyone has all they could wish for and there's no envy, resentment, or need for justice and property laws. This may seem like a fantasy world, but Hume explains that, even today, when something is freely available (such as air and water) we don't create rules about property. It's only when things are in short supply that rules need to be set up."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,3,1,"Some folk have defended the liberty of the seas on the same grounds. However, since the advantages gained by navigation aren't limitless, rivalry rears its head and we start to see how problems can arise..."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,3,2,"Hume recognizes the bond that people can feel with their loved ones, with this bond overriding rules of property."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,3,3,"He adds that some folk have tried to build communities that operate in a similar way and have only adopted rules of justice and property when they've found that it wasn't working. Hume's point? Justice only arises when it's useful (in case you haven't noticed, you'll be hearing this word a lot)."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,3,4,"To demonstrate this, Hume imagines a scenario in which resources are no longer plentiful and everyone's seriously gloomy. In this case, Hume suggests that people's self-preservation instincts are likely to kick in. After a shipwreck, for example, people's priority is to take hold of whatever they can to ensure their survival. Hey, desperate times call for desperate measures (turns out that even Wilson has a dark side)."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,3,5,"Hume sees war as another suspension of justice. Whenever justice no longer offers any advantage, it's overtaken by other concerns."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,3,6,"Now, Hume tackles the question of how and why rules of property and justice have been invented and become so widespread. Hume points out that societies don't usually operate at the extremes mentioned above, but instead occupy a middle ground. Our main interests may lie with ourselves and those close to us, but we learn that keeping up with wider society can be useful too."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,3,7,"The idea of a benevolent society in which everyone looks out for everyone else may have its appeal (just ask the Care Bears). Poetry, for instance, can depict a world in which the weather's perfect, natural resources are in full supply, and no one suffers or causes suffering—a world in which rules of justice aren't needed."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,3,8,"Hume mentions the poetry of the Golden Age as a prime example, contrasting it with philosophical fiction that explores the State of Nature. In this philosophical account, humans began as violent savages who had to rely on themselves. There were no laws, property, or systems of justice, but the result wasn't love and hugs—it was nonstop war. Oops."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,3,9,"Whether humans could live (or continue to live) in this way is something that Hume doubts. As he notes, people are usually raised by their families to recognize appropriate behavior. Still, if this state of ongoing war and violence were real, Hume would see it as another scenario in which the laws of justice would be abandoned."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,3,10,"Hume then sketches out another imaginary scenario in which, as well as us, there's another species of creatures that are weak in body and mind. Hume emphasizes the inequality of this arrangement—humans would wield total authority, our compassion being the only thing keeping us in check. Hume compares this to the way that some groups (e.g., women and people of different races or nationalities) have been treated, though Hume adds that women have often been able to share in society's rights and privileges. So, it's not all bad."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,3,11,"Hume ends by giving us another imaginary scenario in which each person lives wholly for himself or herself and there's no society. But what happens if nature takes its course and families start to emerge? And what if several families come together to form a society? Finally, what happens if a bunch of societies decide that it's a good idea to work together? Can you see where we're going with this? Following this train of thought helps explain how society as we know it today came into being."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,17,0,"We need to use language when outlining a theory, but what definitions should we use? Hume notes that he's aware of the potential for misunderstanding and has been careful about the words that he's used in the Enquiry."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,17,1,"Hume argues that it's hard to draw exact boundaries between virtues and talents (or vices and defects) and to precisely define these terms, but he follows this up with a reassuring point: this is just a matter of words. Phew."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,17,2,"He adds that, on the whole, there seem to be virtues of many different kinds, but calling a person ""virtuous"" is to chiefly praise their social qualities. Someone may be good-natured and honest, but if they're totally lacking in courage, industry, self-control, and dignity, they're hardly models of virtue."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,17,3,"Ultimately, one reason why languages struggle to draw a line between virtues and talents—and vices and defects—is that we don't make much of a distinction between them in our minds. It's more a matter of definitions than how we naturally think."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,17,4,"One factor that makes a quality valued is its rarity. Good-naturedness and honesty are seen as requirements, so possessing them is no biggie. It's when someone defies these codes that we're like, ""whoa there!"" Intellectual qualities tend to be seen as rarer than qualities of the heart, and that's why people are less likely to congratulate themselves in this area: they don't want to be seen as big-headed."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,17,5,"In general, Hume feels that virtues of various kinds can come about from similar sentiments. Sure, the praise given to industry, self-control, and cautiousness may be different than the praise given to other kinds of virtues, but that doesn't make them a different species. The ancient moralists, for instance, didn't make a material division between different species of attributes/defects. These were either virtues or vices—period."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,17,6,"Modern philosophers have often taken a different outlook, with philosophy having become closely linked with theology: a school that, in Hume's view, has warped every branch of knowledge and language. Nope, he's not a fan."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,17,7,"Hume wraps us by stating that a vice, a blemish, or a crime are different expressions but are cut from the same cloth. Likewise, the duties we owe to ourselves and to society probably work from the same principles and attract similar praise. So let's not obsess over this stuff, m'kay?"
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,16,0,Hume's aim in this appendix is to expand on the origin and nature of justice and to explore what makes justice different from other virtues.
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,16,1,"The chief difference is that humanity and benevolence work in an immediate, instinctive way, like with parents' natural sympathy toward their kids. However, justice and fidelity operate on a wider level. In fact, some individual acts can be harmful to society. Because of this, justice doesn't just mean focusing on individual cases but thinking about wider consequences."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,16,2,"For society to run smoothly, property has to be regulated. There'll sometimes be individual hardships in this system, sure, but these rules are adopted with the aim of serving the public."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,16,3,"It's not just about having a blinkered view where all we think about are our immediate, individual actions. Hume uses the example of rowing a boat—success depends on everyone playing their parts."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,16,4,"Let's be real: while systems of justice are supposed to work efficiently and fairly, it's not always this simple."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,16,5,"Sometimes, natural reason doesn't suggest a clear, fixed view of what's useful to the public; that's when laws are called in. However, it's often the case that these fail as well. Rather than solid argument or clear division between true and false, a judge sometimes has to call on sentiment."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,16,6,Hume's point is that rules of justice and property aren't always clear-cut and are sometimes determined by trivial factors.
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,16,7,"Regarding property, Hume states that working with an object that has previously belonged to no one (e.g., cutting down and shaping a tree) creates a new relationship of property. Our sense of public utility and humanity support this, as we look fondly on a person who's carried out an act requiring effort. Feelings of private humanity can't form the origin of justice but they can play a role in individual cases."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,16,8,"Hume applies the concept of property to the natural landscape. Rivers are associated with those who own their banks (though vast rivers are the property of the nation they run through). We could ask, though, what happens if part of a river bank is torn away and becomes part of another bank? Hume explains that this doesn't automatically transfer ownership. It's only when it unites with the land and spreads its roots that it becomes part of a person's property."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,16,9,"Recognizing that individuals may sometimes violate the laws of justice, Hume chews on the harm that this may cause. This can be a private harm if the individual is injured but it can be a public wrong if rules are disobeyed. In Hume's view, the importance of the general good goes alongside a strong sense of the particular. So, if a public wrong is combined with a significant private wrong, that's when things get super serious."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,5,0,"This section begins with a reminder that there would never have been any need for government if every individual had a natural sense of justice. If acting freely never had any negative consequences, then why set limits on it?"
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,5,1,We might assume that states/nations operate according to the same rules of justice as those that rule individuals.
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,5,2,"But, nope, there's a difference: invading another person's property is always seen as a breach of justice. When it comes to nations, though, this bond isn't as strong—they don't always have to cooperate with each other and the boundaries of justice aren't as rigid. In an emergency, states may decide to cast aside the rules of justice and any ties that aren't in their best interests."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,5,3,"Another social structure that Hume explores is the family. Like all this other stuff, Hume sees this as being based on usefulness—babies and kids can't take care of themselves, so it's up to parents to raise them into social beings."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,5,4,"He sees faithfulness as serving this purpose too, though he observes that chastity (aka purity) is demanded of women but seen as not quite so important for men. Hume doesn't get into explaining this tricky subject; he's just saying how things usually are in society. It's like, ""hey, don't shoot the messenger!"""
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,5,5,Hume then refers to incest as a type of behavior that's seen as unacceptable. He notes that people may have the opportunity to engage in this behavior but that it's seen as harmful and totally sketchy.
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,5,6,"Being a tattletale is another thing that's seen as socially unacceptable. Once gossip spreads around, it can cause arguments and all-around bad vibes. This shows that, even where no official laws are broken, there are laws of good manners that we have to follow unless we want to end up as social outcasts."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,5,7,"Next, Hume makes the point that loyalty is super important in some situations, like when we're dealing with people who are close to us. On a more general level, though, there's nothing disloyal or rude about talking with people without any long-term ties. Whatever's useful and agreeable."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,5,8,"We know that laws and codes of conduct play a role in civilized society, but even outside civilized society, ideas about honor and justice can—and do—exist. Robbers and pirates rely on a code of justice among themselves and even wars have rules."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,4,0,"Hume begins by shifting focus from the general idea of justice to particular laws, but he says that the focus is the same either way—it's all about what's good and useful for society."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,4,1,"While some religious types have seen justice as something that's defined from above, Hume believes that we need to look at it on a more grounded level. He has no time for religious fanatics, and is relieved that magistrates don't pay much notice to their views. He adds that there were fanatics of this kind in England during the civil wars, but their moreextreme views alienated them from the general population. Folk were like, ""are these guys for real?"""
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,4,2,"In addition to religious fanatics, Hume muses on whether we could call the Levellers (who believed in sharing property equally) political fanatics. The kind of equality that they advocated may seem ideal to many, but Hume says that common sense and history have shown that it mostly doesn't work. Mostly."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,4,3,"Expanding on this, Hume says that any equality that's established would most likely crumble given people's different personalities, skills, and circumstances. He suggests, too, that this world of equality wouldn't be as benevolent as we might imagine—when people started to show signs of inequality, authority would step in and we could head down a slippery slope to tyranny. Eek!"
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,4,4,"On the other hand, in this world of total equality, who could possess authority in the first place? Like property, no one would have any more or less than their neighbor."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,4,5,"Hume concludes that we need to keep in mind the question: what's most useful to society? Hume uses the concept of property to illustrate this, singling out the terms ""mine"" and ""yours."" This division is something that we've created because we've found it useful. Easy-peasy."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,4,6,"The definition of property may be simple: it's something that's lawful for a person to own and use. Still, we establish and maintain this through all kinds of customs and laws. For all these complexities though, we always come back to the happiness and welfare of society. It's our ultimate go-to."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,4,7,"Hume has no time for superstitions, noting that an Egyptian wouldn't approach bacon for religious reasons but that there's no reason for this based on medicine, chemistry, or physics (for more bacon-related news, head here). The rules of property may sometimes seem to work in a similar way—it's immoral to live in a house on one side of a river, but since the other side has different laws, it's all good to live there. Huh? This can seem pretty random, but Hume stresses that justice and the interests of society form a kind of moral compass."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,4,8,"Unlike hunger and thirst, Hume recognizes that justice has been constructed because it serves a social purpose. As for authorities such as chancellors and juries, they've likewise come about because we need them."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,4,9,"Whereas birds of the same species build their nests in the same way, human beings have framed their houses differently depending on the time and place. Hume uses this example to show the influence of reason and custom."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,4,10,"Even so, Hume notes that the major outlines of houses tend to stay pretty much the same because people have found them handy (though there are always exceptions—check thisout)."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,4,11,"Because property and justice are so well-established, we may take them for granted. Ultimately, though, justice is necessary because it supports society as a whole, and this is the same reason why we value stuff like integrity, loyalty, public spirit, and truthfulness."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,1,0,"Hume begins this section by recognizing that, when it comes to things like friendliness, kindness, and gratitude, it may seem pointless to examine why they're valued so much. C'mon, it's pretty obvious, right?"
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,1,1,"Hume adds that we generally have an even higher opinion of folks that have not only these qualities but strong abilities that they use for the good of all; y'know like Superman, Spiderman, and all that crew."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,1,2,"Hume uses the example of Pericles (a great Athenian general) to sum up his key argument. Hume explains that, when Pericles was on his deathbed, his pals talked glowingly about his many awards and victories. Pericles, however, replied that these ""vulgar advantages"" (II.I.2) were far less important than the happiness and contentment he'd brought to his citizens."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,1,3,"Far from being important only to the likes of Pericles, Hume argues that social virtues like benevolence are even more important to us ordinary folk since we don't usually have epic achievements and successes to fall back on. In general, cut-throat ambition is a less likable trait than ""softer"" virtues such as kindness and compassion."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,1,4,"The theme here is that, ideally, we don't just brag about our own achievements and good points but extend our thoughts and feelings toward other folks, too."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,1,5,"In the final paragraph, Hume remembers that his current aim isn't to gush about the charms of these social virtues; it's to explore how morals are formed and come into practice."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,1,6,"He sums up that no qualities are looked on more fondly than those that relate to sympathy and concern for others, as they play a big role in creating a connection between individuals (after all, friendship is magic)."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,0,0,"Hume starts out by outlining two character types that can be super annoying: people who are into their principles to the point where it gets OTT, and people who don't even believe what they're saying but just want to stir up controversy. As far as Hume's concerned, folks like this are just trolling—all we can hope is that they eventually give it up."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,0,1,"What is worth spending some time on is morality; chiefly, whether morality is based mainly on reason or on sentiment. Plus, we need to ask whether morality is a universal thing where everyone sees eye-to-eye or whether it's more complicated."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,0,2,"Hume points out that the ancient philosophers claimed to be all about reason but, actually, seem to have viewed morals as deriving from taste and sentiment. On the flip side, modern enquirers have talked about ""the beauty of virtue, and deformity of vice"" (I.4) but seem to have based their ideas on abstract thinking. See, we're dealing with a tangled web of disagreement and confusion."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,0,3,"Hume's main beef is with the idea that morality is based purely on reason. Sure, there are areas in which facts and reason are most important (hello,geometry), but if we consider how we react to poetry or to emotions such as love and humor, it's clear that we're not just dealing with facts."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,0,4,This isn't an either/or thing though—Hume points to a criminal trial as a scenario where we need to get the facts and then call on sentiment to decide whether something's morally right or wrong.
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,0,5,"Hume ends by giving us an idea of what to expect in the following sections. His overall aim is to consider the roles that reason and sentiment play in real-world scenarios and viewpoints. By looking at particular examples, Hume believes we can reach wider conclusions about what's commonly seen as moral and immoral. Sounds like a plan to us."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,0,6,"Hume notes that taking the opposite approach—starting off with commonly held views and then looking at specifics—may technically be more perfect, but, hey, the human race isn't perfect. He then stresses that we can't apply abstract ideas to morality but need to focus on everyday, lived experience."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,0,7,"Hume finishes off by introducing the next section, which will focus on ""the social virtues"": benevolence and justice. He sees this as good starting point because it lays the groundwork for discussing other kinds of virtues. So, let's hop into it."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,13,0,"Here, Hume sums up that virtue isn't about self-denial but the overall good of humanity. No enjoyment is sincere if it's cut off from society. Likewise, if society makes an individual feel unwelcome, it's not so great."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,13,1,"It's about what's practical. For example, liquor is harmful in a way that air and water aren't. People may think there's a clash between selfishness and social sentiments, but Hume sees this as narrow-minded since self-love and benevolence can happily coexist."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,13,2,"Without systems of property, society couldn't function. However, a person might sometimes think that they can carry out an offense without causing any major consequences. We're taught that honesty is the best policy, but a person might argue that there are exceptions and that a wise person would take advantage of them. For Hume, though, it's natural to rebel against any thoughts of this kind. You see? This guy was a beacon of morality."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,13,3,"Some folks do give into temptation, of course. Still, a person who's honest and has any sense of common reflection will see that these folks have lost out: they've gained ""worthless toys"" (IX.II.12) whereas it's the natural pleasures that are priceless."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,12,0,"For Hume, the idea that personal merit is based on useful/agreeable qualities should be obvious. If it's not, then some other theories must have led philosophers astray. Hm, that's quite the subtle jab there, Mr. Hume."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,12,1,"Outside of philosophy, though, Hume observes that the principles that he's discussed are still alive and kicking."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,12,2,"This is why, in his view, sensible folk have rejected ""monkish virtues"" (XI.I.3) such as self-denial, solitude, and fasting—they don't serve a purpose to society or increase a person's own enjoyment. So what use are they?"
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,12,3,One of the plus points that Hume associates with his theory is that it doesn't get into squabbles about degrees of benevolence/self-interest. He sees it as enough to conclude that some degree of benevolence is part of our nature.
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,12,4,"As for ambition, greed, and vanity, these may produce strong passions but they can't form the basis of a moral theory; firstly because they don't have the proper aim, but also because they're not as common or comprehensive as a general sense of humanity."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,12,5,"For example, if a man battles his enemy or rival, we understand that he's driven by his own circumstances and sentiments. However, if this same guy calls another person vicious or hateful, he's applying a more universal principle."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,12,6,"Hume acknowledges that this more general sense of humanity may not be as powerful as emotions such as vanity and ambition, but it's still the only basis for morality."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,12,7,"It's normal to have some sense of vanity in relation to people who know us. If we think about humanity in a wider sense, though, it's clear that this is no great shakes: that's why we shift our focus to whether our behavior is useful and agreeable to society in general."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,12,8,"We do, however, adjust our boundaries when we're thinking about other societies and cultures; e.g., if a society isn't as civilized as ours, it has different standards of behavior."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,12,9,"Once we've established this sense of morality, the next step is to put it into words. It's by doing this that social customs and rules of justice are established."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,12,10,"As well as feeling strong passions regarding ourselves and the people closest to us, we can feel similar sentiments about wider society; e.g., people can be involved in public uproar and protests. So, our individual passions sometimes give way to social principles."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,12,11,"While selfish emotions can sometimes go against the social good, we shouldn't assume that this is always the case."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,12,12,"For instance, Hume suggests that a love of fame and a desire to build a name for ourselves encourages us to look at ourselves through other people's eyes. Because we care how others see us, we get into the habit of self-surveillance and this keeps a sense of right and wrong in our minds."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,12,13,"Our individual state of mind can have an effect on those around us too, with Hume pointing out that serenity, dignity, tenderness, and cheerfulness are naturally pleasing to other people. When someone's grouchy, angry, or immoral, then this doesn't just impact them but the rest of us as well."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,12,14,"Hume assures us that, at the moment, he's convinced that personal merit depends on usefulness/agreeableness."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,12,15,"However, he can't believe that the tides, the heavenly bodies, and even infinity have been measured and calculated, yet people still dispute the foundation of morals. What's up with that?"
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,6,0,"Hume kicks off this section by observing that, in daily life, utility is where it's at. Returning to the example of a building, Hume notes that any structure that doesn't seem properly fit for its purpose makes us go ""urgh."" The same goes for folks whose behavior is harmful to society, but, in these cases, we experience a stronger emotional response."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,6,1,"Do moral distinctions come from education and politicians? Hume agrees that they can be influential, but he disagrees that morality stems from these areas. For Hume, ideas about morality could never have been invented if there weren't something in our nature that was open to them. Hume's like, ""work with me here, people!"""
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,6,2,"If every individual recognizes that they can't exist apart from society, it follows that any virtue that benefits society gets our approval. We have a sense of self-interest, sure, but we combine this with a sense of the public good."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,6,3,"Some folks have argued that, really, we're selfish at heart. Hume, however, doesn't buy this. Why do we praise or criticize actions that have taken place in the past or in other countries? These actions don't have any direct connection with us, yet we still respond to them. You've gotta hand it to Hume—he knows how to fight his corner."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,6,4,"When thinking about people and actions that aren't directly relevant to us, Hume recognizes that we may feel stronger emotions about stuff that's closer to home. Still, the very fact that we feel emotions about events that don't concern us suggests that it's not just selfishness that shapes our thoughts."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,6,5,"One explanation for our reaction is that we put ourselves in the place of these individuals, using our imaginations to transport ourselves into the past. However, Hume argues that real sentiment or passion can never come out of imaginary interest. He goes on to argue that it's by experience that we're able to go beyond our basic sense of right vs. wrong to think more deeply."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,6,6,"Hume concludes by bringing us back to his mantra: usefulness is agreeable. He emphasizes that we don't only think about what's useful to ourselves, but also to other individuals and society. This is why we can take an interest in actions that occurred in the past or in faraway countries. We may not view them in exactly the same way as we do our immediate surroundings, but this doesn't mean we flat-out don't care."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,7,0,"Hume understands why some folks have seen public concern as rooted in self-interest. However, he reaffirms that public interest still provokes our moral sentiment. Hume doesn't want to examine why we have a sense of humanity; he wants to take it as given that we're not all just ""meh"" about anything to do with other people."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,7,1,"Hume then sketches out a possible scenario: we enter a warm, comfortable apartment and are introduced to the landlord and his family—all of whom are happy and friendly. Our natural response is pleasure and sympathy. So when the landlord talks about how he has a nightmare neighbor, we feel bad."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,7,2,"Hume uses the theater as another example. When an audience watches a play, it's a joint experience where individuals share in their emotional responses. Another aim is for the audience to feel a connection with the characters and care about what happens to them. It works the other way around too if the actors can get a buzz from the presence of an audience."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,7,3,"Moving on to poetry, Hume sees the pastoral variety as the most entertaining, as it presents gentle, tranquil imagery that transfers a similar sentiment to us. It's like the poetry equivalent of a lullaby."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,7,4,"Hume acknowledges that, sometimes, we may get more attached to sentiments resembling those we feel in our own lives. Still, one of the aims of poetry is to bring us closer to whatever emotions are being conveyed. Here, Hume notes that stating the facts doesn't always have this effect—it's when a scenario is set before us and grabs our attention that it has the ""wow"" factor."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,7,5,"Hume's next point is that, when we know that something's true, this brings it closer to us. In fact, we can feel major concern about things that don't directly relate to us as long as they're true and they appeal to our sympathy."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,7,6,"While sympathy brings to mind emotions such as compassion and kindness, Hume points out that we're not always just talking about the nice stuff. If we observe people's obedience to unjust leaders/political parties, we can see that social sympathy isn't always so great."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,7,7,"Hume suggests that, when we hear about events that happened in the distant past or faraway lands, it's often the more dramatic stuff that grabs our attention. However, even small-scale issues can engage our sympathy: if a person stutters, we feel bad for them. (Did you know that Lewis Carroll stuttered? Check out his poem about it here.)"
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,7,8,"In any case, our reactions are based on whether something promotes wellbeing and happiness. That's why health and energy are agreeable, as are clothes that are comfortable and suited to their purpose."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,7,9,"Ultimately, we can't judge anyone without considering the benefits and dangers that their actions pose to society."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,7,10,"Hume goes on to state that everyone has some awareness of good and evil. Of course, some individuals put aside social concerns in favor of their own self-interest. Hume's point is that, where there's no personal benefit to be gained, people generally lean toward whatever promotes happiness."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,7,11,"While Hume talks about widespread sympathy, he again acknowledges that we tend to have a stronger reaction toward events and people that are closer to us. Also, each of us has our own likes and dislikes. That's why there needs to be a general standard of vice/virtue based on public usefulness. Expressing moral sentiment is great, but it's when people act in a way that's useful to society that they're seen as A+ citizens."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,7,12,"Hume concludes that there are countless instances in which people express a natural concern for others and the interests of society. Because of this, we can say that human beings are equipped with a benevolent principle. Got it? Awesome. Now we can move onto other sentiments that arise from the same or similar principles."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,14,0,"Hume now returns to his opening question: how far does reason or sentiment enter into our moral decisions? As we know, Hume sees reason as important in sizing up whether something's beneficial to the individual and/or society."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,14,1,"Because individual situations aren't identical, it's vital to establish general rules of justice. Reason therefore helps decide what's in society's long-term interests."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,14,2,"Though it can guide us as to what's useful or harmful, reason isn't enough to produce moral blame. Whatever end goal we're talking about, we wouldn't care if it weren't for sentiment."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,14,3,"Despite his convictions, Hume plays devil's advocate and asks whether there's some other theory that can explain morality. He argues that such a theory will probably never be found. For one thing, some theories are too vague and general. Also, Hume points to ingratitude as a vice that can't be explained by reason alone—we feel the sentiment of blame in our mind. Well, someone is certainly confident in his work."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,14,4,"There may be situations in which we're not aware of all the details and can't make an informed judgment: where someone has killed another person, we're influenced by whether this was in self-defense. Intellectual inquiry is necessary in the first place, but we have to use our heart too."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,14,5,"Comparing moral sentiment with natural beauty makes Hume's theory all the more obvious. If we look at an object, we can see that it's made up of lines and figures. However, these don't make it beautiful—it's the overall effect that does the trick. Likewise, when we're presented with a moral issue, it's not enough to employ reason; we react using our sentiment and this produces compassion or disapproval."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,14,6,Hume recaps his point by contrasting human beings with objects. If we try to apply the same logic to both then we see that it fails: for a tree to topple and destroy its parent doesn't produce the same emotional response as a human murdering a family member (just imagine if it did).
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,14,7,"If we look to the ultimate ends of our actions, we again see that they can't be explained by reason alone. Hume uses exercise as an example: if we ask someone why they exercise, they might answer that it's for their health. If we then ask why this is desirable, the person may respond that sickness is painful (well, duh!). If we ask why the person hates pain—what are they supposed to say? It's like, ""c'mon. Seriously?"" We all know that hating pain is a natural response. Talk about stating the obvious."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,14,8,Hume's conclusion? The ultimate ends of human actions can't be accounted for by reason but by sentiment.
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,15,0,"Hume here returns to a theory discussed earlier: that selfishness is at the heart of everything. Hume criticizes this theory, arguing that you'd have to have corrupt heart or use really shallow, careless reasoning to think this way."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,15,1,"We might assume that folks who have this opinion are unable to feel true benevolence. However, Hume recognizes that some famous philosophers maintained this selfish system but led faultless lives. Hume points out that this system can still recognize the differences among people: not everyone sees things the same way or acts the same way. Because of this, someone can be seen as moral or immoral even in this system."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,15,2,"Even though selfishness gets a bad rap, it's not a bad thing as long as it's combined with concern for others and usefulness to society. What Hume's doing here is making a distinction between partial selfishness and universal selfishness."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,15,3,"Hume observes that there's one obvious objection to the theory of selfishness; namely, that benevolence and generosity are natural instincts that are plainly different to selfishness. This is pretty obvious to anyone, so to argue that everything's based on selfishness is a stretch."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,15,4,"In contrast to the selfish theory, Hume points to scenarios that hinge on love for others, e.g., people's love for their kids. Hume's argument is therefore that self-interest plays a role but isn't the driving force that some other philosophers claim."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,10,0,"Meanwhile, at a local saloon—a kind of fancy place with some really stylish details, like ""shimmering glasses"" and ""many-hued decanters"" (11.2)—Pete is behind the bar in a white jacket doing bartender-y things like pouring beer and drying glasses."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,10,1,"Jimmie comes in with his pal Billie. They are both so good to go that we almost feel sorry for Pete, except that he has spoiled sweet Maggie. And not in the way your grandma spoils you—we're talking the spoiled milk kind of spoiled."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,10,2,"A full-blown fistfight ensues. Glass smashing, cups flying, fists in the air. It's a violent spectacle… until the cops show up and Jimmie escapes through a side door."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,11,0,"Some time has passed, and we find Pete and Maggie in an ""irregular shaped"" hall. The vibe of the venue has changed, and the classy factor seems to have nosedived. The seduction is over."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,11,1,"Maggie still worships Pete as a valiant hero, while his interest seems to have waned some. She is reconciled with her decision to leave home and become sort of... unmarriageable, shall we say."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,11,2,"What with his dapper dress and valiant ways, Pete rescued her from ""her former Rum Alley environment"" (12.10) and the ""cursed jays,"" a.k.a. Maggie's mother and brother."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,8,0,"Mary gets kicked out of the local saloon, an event she does not take well. The local collection of street urchins finds amusement in her anger, taunting and laughing, but it's not pretty to anyone else."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,8,1,"Not one for subtlety, Mary kicks in the door of the apartment, where Jimmie greets her. A tussle ensues."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,8,2,"Pete arrives just in time to witness the violent family episode. Mary takes the opportunity to humiliate Maggie, accusing her of all sorts of shameful behavior, calling her a ""disgrace,"" and in not so many words, telling her she is a worthless, shall we say, lady of the night."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,8,3,Pete and Maggie beat a hasty retreat.
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,9,0,Jimmie starts to get a little irked about Pete coming by and compromising his sister's reputation.
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,9,1,"A neighbor provokes Jimmie even more by reporting that she overheard Maggie basically begging Pete to love her. This can only mean one thing: Maggie has not acted so ladylike. He reports to his mom that Maggie has ""gone teh deh devil"" (10.17). So much for sibling loyalty, we guess…"
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,9,2,Mary is thoroughly perplexed about how Maggie could have become such a bad girl after being raised in such a decent and morally upstanding household. Why? Why? Why?
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,9,3,"It doesn't help that Mary curses her daughter, but Jimmie's off to take care of business in the form of—you guessed it—a brawl. Bring it on."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,2,0,"The old neighbor has problems of her own. She's a beggar and a thief, but for now, she's Jimmie's only option. She dispatches Jimmie to buy her a can of beer."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,2,1,"Unfortunately, Jimmie's father intercepts him and steals the beer. He can't cope with the ""livin hell"" at home either."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,2,2,"Jimmie hangs out before returning to the apartment. He can hear his parents fighting, threatening, and perpetrating violence on each other; the neighbors comment on how ""Ol' Johnson"" is at it again. Apparently the parents have earned a bit of a reputation for hand-to-hand combat."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,2,3,"Jimmie finally gathers the courage to return, and when he does, he finds his drunken parents passed out on the floor."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,2,4,"He and Maggie hold each other, quivering and scared, until ""the ghost mists of dawn"" (3.33) arrive."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,3,0,"The baby, Tommie, and ""Ol' Johnson,"" the father, are dead, which seems to be no big deal. Weird. One can only imagine why."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,3,1,Obviously some time has gone by.
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,3,2,"Jimmie and Maggie are still around, though. And now Jimmie has a sassy attitude: sneering, hating the world, ready for a fight, and generally being a very ticked-off guy. Best to stay out of his way. He also likes to hang out and just watch life pass him by. Oh, and he hates anyone who practices religion or wears nice clothes. And he also has beef with pedestrians. Yeah, he has become what one might call a hater."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,3,3,Jimmie gets a job as a truck driver. Did someone say road rage? He spends his days driving around New York City looking for trouble—he only has respect for one thing: fire engines.
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,3,4,"Shockingly, Jimmie has a bit of a rap sheet, what with all of his battles and brawls."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,17,0,"There's Pete—in a saloon, no less, but now he's a customer. He is a fine mess, drunk and buying drinks for a group of female hangers-on who are clearly using him. The waiter is disgusted by the drunken scene, which is saying something, since he's seen it all."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,17,1,"Nellie—she of ""brilliance and audacity"" fame—is there. Pete tells her over and over that he's ""stuck on"" (18.49) her, but she leaves him to his pathetic stupor. Not before she takes his last dollars, though. Pete has sunk low in his own low-sinking way."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,17,2,"The scene ends with Pete passed out on the floor, red wine dripping from the table down onto his neck."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,16,0,"Several months later… a painted lady walks down the street. Attempts to make eye contact with men fail. We assume this is Maggie, poor thing, now a prostitute looking for some man to pick her up."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,16,1,"Men stare and offer excuses; no one is interested. She continues walking down the wet, cold streets until she gets to the river. What will happen to poor Maggie?"
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,5,0,"She's cute, and he's a ""warrior,"" ""invincible,"" and a ""formidable man."" Suffice it to say, she's hooked on the Pete Kool-Aid."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,5,1,"Now her house seems even grimmer. She passes the time thinking about Pete and his job, his friends, his money, and just how generally superior he is to everything in her sad-sack life."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,5,2,"Anticipating Pete's next visit, Maggie spruces up the house with some drapery. Apparently it—or something—works, because he asks her out to see a show."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,5,3,"She's all excited because everyone is afraid of him. He is clearly the Big Man on Campus, and crowds part when he comes down the sidewalk."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,5,4,"Momma Mary is still getting wasted, so of course she embarrasses Maggie when Pete comes to pick her up. Thanks, Mom."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,4,0,"Back to Maggie, a pretty young girl in a dilapidated tenement. What hope does she have growing up on Rum Alley? Her delicate beauty is lost on her co-workers at the sweatshop, where she sews collars and cuffs."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,4,1,"Jimmie's in charge of the house now. Drunken Mary is still around, getting into scraps and developing her own relationship with police justices. Let's just say she's on a first-name basis with the local Bowery cops."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,4,2,Then along comes Pete—he's that guy who saved Jimmie's tail when he was getting into it with those Devil's Row urchins oh so many years ago.
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,4,3,"Through Maggie's eyes, Pete is a hunk and a savior. His contempt for the world and air of superiority floats her boat; she's all in."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,4,4,"As she stares Pete down, Maggie becomes hyper-aware of the filth and disarray of her home. Compared to this noble gentleman (her thoughts), her surroundings are an embarrassment."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,4,5,"She decides that he is the ""ideal man"" (5.25)."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,1,0,Home life in the dark and dreary tenement is no treat either.
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,1,1,"""[S]mall and ragged"" Maggie—the big sister—and ""bawling"" Tommie (2.2)—the baby brother—are there to greet father and Jimmie in the family's chaotic, filthy apartment."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,1,2,"In terms of human wrath, no one compares to Mother Mary. She's Jimmie, Maggie, and Tommie's mom, as well as a raging alcoholic abuser who careens around the apartment and busts up furniture just to make a point. Nothing makes her more abusive than her son's relentless habit of getting into fights, though, and today she comes out swinging."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,1,3,"Oh, and Dad's an alcoholic, too, but he likes to seek respite by doing his drinking at a local bar."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,1,4,Jimmie receives some sympathy from a neighbor.
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,0,0,"Spoiler alert: This book starts at the bottom of the heap and ends at the, er, bottomer of the heap."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,0,1,The book opens with violence (get used to it). A ragamuffin named Jimmie is fighting with other Bowery neighborhood urchins to represent Rum Alley—a seriously down-and-out area—against the thugs from Devil's Row.
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,0,2,"These kids don't pull any punches, and Jimmie is good to go, though he's outnumbered. Luckily, a bigger kid named Pete come to the rescue… sort of. At least he provides some cheerleading. Pete's too cool for school, with a sneer and a cigar stump, but he helps Jimmie, so how bad can he be?"
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,0,3,"Another fight flares up with some more kicking and pounding, but this time Jimmie's dad arrives on the scene and gives his son a swift kick to the head."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,0,4,"With that, it's time to go home."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,18,0,"Mary's sitting monk-like and having a meal, when in comes Jimmie to very unceremoniously report that Maggie is dead."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,18,1,"Mary—way too late—begins to express a little love for her daughter. It's hard not to want to slap her. She makes a spectacle of herself, wailing and carrying on while neighbors attempt to console her; Miss Smith repeatedly assures her that God will judge Mary for her sins. Phew?"
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,18,2,"Mary decides she'll forgive Maggie, moaning ""I'll fergive her! I'll fergive her!"" (19.28)."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,13,0,"What would she do without Pete? Maggie has been out of the house for three weeks and Pete is her everything, which is never a good thing, ladies. They continue to hang out at a sequence of seedy bars and cheesy entertainment venues."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,13,1,"Pete no longer gazes at Maggie the same way, though, and now she stares at him ""spaniel-like"" just hoping for a sign…"
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,13,2,"Enter Nellie: ""A woman of brilliance and audacity"" (14.5). Whatever attention Pete was paying to Maggie immediately evaporates; this old flame is suddenly all Pete cares about."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,13,3,"A really cringe-worthy exchange ensues in which Pete pants over Nellie, Nellie puts on airs, Nellie's boy escort—a.k.a. Freddie—sulks, and Maggie fumes. The two spurned lovers look on while Nellie and Pete ""reminisce of days together"" (14.15)."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,13,4,"The more Nellie humiliates and dismisses Pete, the more he follows her around. Pretty soon the two of them leave together, and Maggie is left sitting with Freddie (whose real name is Mike). He takes it upon himself to clarify this situation for the rosy-tinted Maggie: Nellie and Pete aren't coming back."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,13,5,"Maggie announces she is going home, a concept that Mike/Freddie does not seem to grasp—like, home? What's that?"
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,13,6,She gets up and leaves.
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,12,0,"When Jimmie finally makes it back home after fighting with Pete, Mary is fit to be tied—she says that Maggie is a good-for-nothing so-and-so who has compromised her morality and ruined the family's reputation. Mary concludes by describing her daughter as wicked."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,12,1,"Jimmie makes a feeble attempt to defend Maggie, but it's a no go. He attempts to put himself in someone else's shoes… maybe all those women he has dated have brothers? Maybe he's no different from that cad Pete? On second thought: nah."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,12,2,"In fact, Jimmie decides he's so definitely different from Pete that if anyone in the neighborhood brings up Maggie's relationship with the guy, Jimmie will not defend his sister's honor. Ouch."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,6,0,"Does Pete know how to party? You betcha. He loves himself a spectacle, so he takes Maggie to music halls, burlesque shows, and all manner of lowbrow entertainment. For Maggie, the escape from life at home is more than welcome."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,6,1,"She really digs hanging out with Pete at the smoky orchestra performances, drinking beer and mingling with the masses. Pete stands out because he's a real gentleman, and she loves how he works the whole classy angle for her."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,6,2,But Maggie sees Pete as more than just a night at the theater spent watching people sing and ventriloquists do their acts—he's her ticket out of the dump that is Rum Alley.
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,6,3,"Pete's really into Maggie, too; she can tell because he stares at her a lot and asks her to kiss him. She's not down for smooching, though. Bummer for Pete—he thought he was going to get some."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,7,0,"Maggie starts getting stressed about her wardrobe. Dating Pete has upped the ante, and it seems like every lady on the street has nicer clothes. This stinks."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,7,1,"She also starts to worry that she's going to become an old hag, like some of her co-workers at the collar and cuff factory."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,7,2,"Pete is showing Maggie a really good time: dime shows, menageries, museums, a whole world of culture she never knew existed. Oh—and the melodramas with damsels in distress. What a knight in shining armor Pete is."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,7,3,"These shows are infinitely entertaining. The villains so villainous and the heroes so, well, heroic. Maggie is ready to climb on stage and become a character in one of the plays; she wonders if she might act the part of a classy lady just like actresses do on stage."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,14,0,"A ""forlorn woman"" is wandering down a crowded avenue. Surely, it must be Maggie—she's the definition of forlorn."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,14,1,"But wait… it isn't Maggie; it's Hattie. Apparently Jimmie has done his own number on a woman and now she's trying to track him down. It looks like Jimmie is no better than Pete after all, especially since he rejects her in an equally roguish way."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,14,2,"Back at Rum Alley: Maggie has returned home (she has nowhere else to go), and Mom is milking the opportunity to make Maggie feel like a rotten piece of you-know-what. Mary downright enjoys humiliating her daughter, while the denizens of Rum Alley turn the reunion into a spectacle."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,15,0,"Pete has no clue the trouble he hath wrought. Maggie has nowhere to turn, and not even Jimmie comes to her defense. But in-between thoughts of his new old love—""the woman of brilliance and audacity""—Pete feels some nagging guilt. He tries to push it away."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,15,1,He really hopes Maggie doesn't go to the bar where he works; he already got a talking-to about keeping the place respectable.
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,15,2,"So, of course, enter Maggie. She has nowhere to go, but Pete doesn't care (duh)."
Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,15,3,"Maggie finds herself walking the streets, which is not a thing a ""good"" girl would do back then. Men are avoiding contact with her. No one will save her soul. She is extra doomed."
Cymbeline,10,0,Welcome back to Rome.
Cymbeline,10,1,"Posthumus and Philario are discussing politics. Cymbeline was supposed to pay a tribute (as in money, not a nice speech) to the Romans. The two countries have worked out a system where Britain pays Rome so they don't go to war. Cymbeline hasn't paid up yet."
Cymbeline,10,2,"But who can think about politics when there's news of Imogen? Iachimo is back from his little adventure, and he's about to catch these guys up."
Cymbeline,10,3,Posthumus is sure that Iachimo's swift return means he was unsuccessful with Imogen.
Cymbeline,10,4,"Iachimo tells him his bride is the fairest of them all. Then he says: ""The ring is won."" Translation: he slept with Imogen and won the bet."
Cymbeline,10,5,But Posthumus has more faith in Imogen than that. He doesn't believe Iachimo for one minute.
Cymbeline,10,6,So Iachimo describes Imogen's bedchamber in detail. He doesn't leave anything out.
Cymbeline,10,7,"Posthumus still refuses to believe Iachimo. That proves nothing, he says; Iachimo might have heard those particulars from him or from someone else. It doesn't mean Imogen cheated on him."
Cymbeline,10,8,Iachimo brings in the heavy artillery: he shows Posthumus the bracelet.
Cymbeline,10,9,"Posthumus is ready to hand over the ring. He still can't believe his dear Imogen would do this to him, especially with nasty Iachimo, but he can't think of how else this dude could have nabbed the bracelet."
Cymbeline,10,10,Posthumus goes through all the scenarios but can't come up with one that makes sense. Imogen wears it everywhere—even her maids know she loves that bracelet. She wouldn't part with it.
Cymbeline,10,11,So Posthumus finally believes Iachimo.
Cymbeline,10,12,Philario says the bracelet isn't proof enough: it could have been stolen. (Ahem. It was.)
Cymbeline,10,13,Then Iachimo delivers the fatal blow: did he mention that Imogen has a mole on her breast? He kissed it when he was with her.
Cymbeline,10,14,"Posthumus hands over the ring and curses all women everywhere. Every evil and cruel thing men do can be traced back to women, he says. How can women be so charming when they're always just deceiving men?"
Cymbeline,11,0,The Roman ambassador Caius Lucius has not come to Britain on a friendly visit: he wants to know why Cymbeline has not paid the tribute money to Rome yet.
Cymbeline,11,1,"Lucius fills us in on the history of the tribute. Back when Julius Caesar conquered Britain, he set up a tribute in the sum of 3,000 pounds to be paid every year to Rome. In return, Rome would refrain from invading Britain."
Cymbeline,11,2,"The Queen jumps in and says the fee will never be paid again. Hmm… that seems like a decision Cymbeline should make, doesn't it?"
Cymbeline,11,3,"Always looking for a chance to make a fool of himself, Cloten blunders through some reasons why Britain shouldn't pay."
Cymbeline,11,4,"Cymbeline finally puts a stop to the madness, mainly because no one can really understand what Cloten is going on about. Cymbeline refuses to pay the money, and Lucius declares Britain an enemy. He's sorry to do it, but it has to be done."
Cymbeline,11,5,"Cymbeline knows that this means war, and he hates the thought of it. He wants peace with Rome."
Cymbeline,11,6,"Cloten, however, is boastful and taunts Lucius all the more."
Cymbeline,8,0,"Back in her room, Imogen goes to bed. She prays that the fairies and tempters of the night will not harm her, and then she goes to sleep."
Cymbeline,8,1,The trunk Imogen promised to guard is safely stowed away in her room.
Cymbeline,8,2,"Just then, Iachimo emerges from the trunk. What? Is this for real?"
Cymbeline,8,3,"It totally is: Iachimo couldn't get Imogen to agree to cheat on Posthumus, so he'll just have to trick Posthumus into believing she did."
Cymbeline,8,4,Iachimo looks for proof that he was with Imogen. He takes in every detail about the room. But then he figures that he should come back with more convincing proof than just an inventory of her curtains and bed.
Cymbeline,8,5,"Aha: the bracelet. Iachimo takes the bracelet off Imogen's wrist, and then he sees a mole ""clinque-spotted"" (translation: it's got five spots) on her breast."
Cymbeline,8,6,"Iachimo's got the evidence he needs to convince Posthumus, so he runs off before he's discovered."
Cymbeline,9,0,Cloten figures that the way to a lady's heart is through music. So he orders musicians to serenade Imogen as she wakes.
Cymbeline,9,1,"When that doesn't work, Cloten dismisses the musicians. Cymbeline and the Queen see this and tell him to keep it up: they really want this marriage to happen—despite the fact that, you know, Imogen is already married."
Cymbeline,9,2,"In the middle of the conversation, a messenger enters with news that a man from Rome asks to see the king."
Cymbeline,9,3,"Cymbeline is worried because he knows the guy from Rome is angry, but he figures he should greet him."
Cymbeline,9,4,Cloten takes his mom and stepdad's advice to heart: he'll be persistent whether Imogen likes him or not.
Cymbeline,9,5,"Cloten knocks on Imogen's door, and one of her ladies in waiting answers. Ever the klutz, Cloten tries to bribe the lady for the gossip on Imogen. He's kidding himself."
Cymbeline,9,6,"None of this works, of course. Imogen comes out while Cloten's making a fool of himself trying to give the lady gold."
Cymbeline,9,7,Imogen is cold toward Cloten and calls him a fool. Cloten retorts by saying that she's disobeying her father by marrying someone other than him.
Cymbeline,9,8,"Imogen tells Cloten he's too ""base"" (translation: unworthy) to be even Posthumus's servant. Then she tells him that even Posthumus's cheapest clothes (""meanest garment"") are more valuable to her than Cloten."
Cymbeline,9,9,It's on.
Cymbeline,9,10,"Cloten is furious and vows to take vengeance on Posthumus. He's so shocked that he keeps muttering stuff about Posthumus's ""garment."""
Cymbeline,9,11,"But Imogen doesn't really care. During the insult slewing, Pisanio came in, and now Imogen orders him to find her precious bracelet."
Cymbeline,9,12,"Imogen remembers that the bracelet was on her arm, and she kissed it. It's gone now, though, and she's really worried about it."
Cymbeline,9,13,"They all exit: Pisanio and Imogen to find the bracelet, and Cloten to yell about how he's gonna get revenge on Imogen for dissing him."
Cymbeline,24,0,"Lucius, Iachimo, and the Roman army enter on one side of the stage; the British army enters on the other. Posthumus follows."
Cymbeline,24,1,Iachimo loses his sword to Posthumus (in disguise) and feels guilty about pretending to hook up with Posthumus's girl.
Cymbeline,24,2,"After Posthumus has left, Iachimo says he feels bad for slandering Imogen's good name. He figures that he is like all Romans—mere mortals—unlike British, who men are gods."
Cymbeline,24,3,"The battle rages on, and Cymbeline is overtaken."
Cymbeline,24,4,"It's Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus to the rescue. The three men rescue Cymbeline. Then Posthumus enters along with more British peeps."
Cymbeline,24,5,Lucius realizes he and the Romans are defeated.
Cymbeline,25,0,Posthumus runs into a couple of British lords who had fled from the fight. He tells them what happened in the battle.
Cymbeline,25,1,The lords find it strange that an old man and two boys could save the day.
Cymbeline,25,2,Posthumus is in a really bad mood and makes fun of them by coming up with a little riddle about the battle. Real mature.
Cymbeline,25,3,"Not really understanding what's happening, the lords just figure that Posthumus is really angry, though they can't understand why."
Cymbeline,25,4,"Once the lords leave, Posthumus gets rid of his British clothes and puts his Roman uniform on again. Huh?"
Cymbeline,25,5,Posthumus wants to punish himself for Imogen's death by dying himself.
Cymbeline,25,6,"Two captains enter and declare how grateful everyone is for the four men who saved the day. Aside from the old man and two young boys, there was another man in ""silly habit"" (translation: weird clothes). That fourth man would be Posthumus."
Cymbeline,25,7,"Now that the war's over, no one can find any of the men."
Cymbeline,25,8,The captains find Posthumus and see that he is a Roman. They decide to take him to the king for punishment.
Cymbeline,2,0,Cloten is certain he would have defeated Posthumus in a fight. At least that's what he tells a couple of lords hangin' in the public square.
Cymbeline,2,1,"Of course, of course, the lords tell him. You'd destroy him and turn him into a carcass."
Cymbeline,2,2,"But then the lords tell us what they really think. One lord says Cloten's so much a fool you couldn't even measure his foolishness on the ground. Oh, snap."
Cymbeline,2,3,"When Cloten says someone would have been hurt in the fight, the lord tells us it doesn't hurt when asses fall. Yep, he's calling Cloten an ass."
Cymbeline,2,4,"Luckily, Cloten is none the wiser about all of these snarls and jokes behind his back. That only makes us think he's all the more foolish."
Cymbeline,3,0,"Imogen begs Pisanio for any morsel about her lovey-dovey, Posthumus. When she asks what he heard Posthumus talk about last, Pisanio says it was about her, of course."
Cymbeline,3,1,"Pisanio remembers his master kissed his handkerchief and waved it goodbye. Then Imogen wishes she were that handkerchief, so she could be kissed by him. Wait, what? Where have we heard that before? Oh yeah: in Romeo and Juliet."
Cymbeline,3,2,There's lots of talk about how Imogen wishes she were actually with Posthumus. Then Pisanio says his master talked of how he hopes to commune with her in spirit. That's sort of like a Skype date for psychics.
Cymbeline,3,3,"A lady enters, telling Imogen the Queen wants to see her."
Cymbeline,17,0,"Belarius, Polydore (a.k.a. Guiderius), and Cadwal (a.k.a. Arviragus) return to their cave with a deer from their hunt."
Cymbeline,17,1,Suddenly Belarius stops and declares there's a heavenly boy in their cave. (That would be Imogen.)
Cymbeline,17,2,Belarius and the boys ask questions about where this mysterious guy is going and what his name is.
Cymbeline,17,3,"Imogen picks the name ""Fidele"" and tells them she's trying to get to Milford-Haven—""trying"" being the operative word."
Cymbeline,17,4,There's a strange connection between Imogen and the two boys (who are actually her brothers).
Cymbeline,17,5,"Arviragus says he'll love Fidele as a brother, which is kind of funny since she's actually his sister. Imogen feels it, too, and tells us in an aside that if these guys were actually her brothers, she could have married Posthumus without so much drama. She wouldn't have been the heir to the throne then, and she wouldn't have been worth so much to her dad."
Cymbeline,17,6,The three men welcome Imogen in and tell her that she'll have to earn her keep by telling them a story.
Cymbeline,16,0,"Dressed as a boy, Imogen is alone in the woods, wandering around. She's really tired from roaming around for two days."
Cymbeline,16,1,"Imogen remembers two beggars telling her where to go, but she still hasn't come across Lucius. She's lost, and she wonders if Pisanio was playing a trick on her when he said that Lucius would come by the next day."
Cymbeline,16,2,Imogen finds a cave and calls out to see if anyone is in it.
Cymbeline,16,3,"No one answers, so Imogen goes on in and makes herself at home."
Cymbeline,16,4,"We interrupt this program for a helpful reading tip: Worried that your copy of the play divides scenes differently from the way we do here? Don't trip: the division of acts and scenes varies depending on which edition of the play you're reading. Some editions of the play (like Penguin Shakespeare) cut off Act 3, Scene 6 at the end of Imogen's speech and give her meeting with Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus its own section (Act 3, Scene 7). Some other editions (like the Riverside Shakespeare or MIT online) put them all together into one scene."
Cymbeline,16,5,Now back to our program.
Cymbeline,23,0,"At the Roman camp, Posthumus enters and talks to a bloody cloth. We're not kidding, folks: he got it from Pisanio as ""proof"" of Imogen's death."
Cymbeline,23,1,Posthumus feels really bad about Imogen's death. He wishes his servant wouldn't have obeyed him.
Cymbeline,23,2,Posthumus tells us that he's been roped into fighting against the British because he's a Roman resident.
Cymbeline,23,3,"Well, forget that: Posthumus doesn't want to live with any regrets, so he swaps out his Roman uniform for a British one. That way, he won't have to fight against his homeland."
Cymbeline,23,4,Posthumus hopes he can be strong and valiant on the battlefield.
Cymbeline,22,0,"Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus discuss the fight with the Romans. They disagree about what they should do about it."
Cymbeline,22,1,"Always afraid he will be recognized by somebody from the court, Belarius wants to lie low."
Cymbeline,22,2,But Guiderius and Arviragus think that's cowardly; they want to help Cymbeline's forces fight.
Cymbeline,22,3,"It's two against one. Since the boys insist on fighting, Belarius finally agrees. He figures he'll have changed in appearance enough, anyway."
Cymbeline,22,4,The three men set off to fight for Britain.
Cymbeline,5,0,"The Queen shoos her ladies away so she can talk one-on-one with Dr. Cornelius. She's asked him to make a secret potion that will kill anyone who drinks it. Dun-dun-dun. She just wants it for scientific purposes, of course."
Cymbeline,5,1,"Cornelius is no fool. He doesn't trust the Queen to use the poison on animals like she claims. So, he's actually given her something that will make it look like someone is dead. Then, if the Queen gives it to someone, that person can be revived from a deep sleep."
Cymbeline,5,2,"After Cornelius tells us this secret, he leaves."
Cymbeline,5,3,"It turns out Cornelius's instincts were right, because just after he leaves, the Queen gives the potion to Pisanio. She tells him that it's an energy drink. After all, it's saved Cymbeline's life five times already."
Cymbeline,5,4,"Why does the Queen want Pisanio dead? That's simple: he's always praising Posthumus to Imogen. He's all, ""Posthumus can do this, and Posthumus can do that. Look how amazing Posthumus is."""
Cymbeline,5,5,"The Queen figures that if Pisanio's out of the picture, Imogen will forget all about Posthumus. Then Imogen might actually give the Queen's son Cloten a chance. Logic does not appear to be the Queen's strong point."
Cymbeline,5,6,"As if giving Pisanio a poisonous drink weren't enough, the Queen also asks him to talk Cloten up to Imogen."
Cymbeline,5,7,"After the Queen leaves, Pisanio's like, ""As if."" He'll never betray Posthumus and help the Queen."
Cymbeline,4,0,"Enter Iachimo, an Italian talking with a Frenchman, a Dutchman, and a Spaniard about everything that's going on with the British royal family. Looks like the news has made it to Rome (where this scene is set)."
Cymbeline,4,1,"Posthumus has also made it to Rome, where's he lying low in banishment."
Cymbeline,4,2,"Posthumus introduces himself to the lads, and the conversation quickly turns to—what else?—women."
Cymbeline,4,3,"Iachimo thinks any woman can be seduced. Just name the time and place, and he's there."
Cymbeline,4,4,But Posthumus disagrees. Not his new bride: she's too virtuous and honest to ever cheat on him.
Cymbeline,4,5,"""Prove it,"" says Iachimo. He's convinced that there isn't a woman around who could refuse his charms. He'll head on over to England and seduce Imogen. Seriously, this dude is actually suggesting an international seduction plot."
Cymbeline,4,6,"If Iachimo succeeds, he'll take Posthumus's fancy ring (the one from Imogen). He'll also acquire mad bragging rights."
Cymbeline,4,7,"Posthumus is confident enough to take that bet. His terms: if Iachimo strikes out with Imogen, then he'll have to pay Posthumus 10,000 ducats."
Cymbeline,4,8,Challenge accepted.
Cymbeline,4,9,"As the men leave to write down the terms of their wager with a lawyer, the Frenchmen and Philario talk about what just happened. They let us in on a secret about Iachimo: he's not one to let go of things. Uh-oh."
Cymbeline,27,0,"Cymbeline thanks Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus for fighting so bravely for him. He knights them."
Cymbeline,27,1,Cymbeline says it's a real shame that no one could find that other guy who helped fight.
Cymbeline,27,2,Cornelius comes in to report that the Queen has died. In her dying moments she confessed she never loved Cymbeline; she was just a gold-digger who wanted the crown.
Cymbeline,27,3,That's not all: the Queen also said that she hated Imogen and was ready to poison her.
Cymbeline,27,4,Cymbeline is rocked by this news... but it just gets worse.
Cymbeline,27,5,Cornelius tells Cymbeline that the Queen said she was going to poison the king little by little so that Cloten could take the crown.
Cymbeline,27,6,"Cymbeline is floored: he was completely deceived. He chalks it up to the fact that the Queen was hot. Women can be so deceiving, he says."
Cymbeline,27,7,"That business over with, Lucius, Iachimo, Posthumus, and Imogen are brought in. Lucius asks for leniency for everyone, but especially for his boy servant, Imogen. After all, she's British and so young."
Cymbeline,27,8,"Cymbeline feels like he knows the ""boy,"" but he can't place him. He grants ""Fidele"" freedom and gives him one wish. Imogen/Fidele asks to speak to the king in private."
Cymbeline,27,9,"As they leave, Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus whisper to each other and agree that this was the kid who died in their cave. They agree to keep silent and see where this thing goes."
Cymbeline,27,10,"Sure, that's a great plan."
Cymbeline,27,11,"Pisanio also realizes that this ""Fidele"" is someone from his past. The only difference is that he knows ""Fidele"" is actually Imogen."
Cymbeline,27,12,Cymbeline returns with Imogen and instructs Iachimo to answer her questions honestly.
Cymbeline,27,13,Imogen asks Iachimo where he got the ring on his finger. Everyone is a little confused: why would this kid care about that?
Cymbeline,27,14,"Iachimo is reluctant at first, but then he admits that it was Posthumus's and that he tricked him to get it. He recounts the whole scene in the trunk in Imogen's bedchamber."
Cymbeline,27,15,"Posthumus is livid. He calls Iachimo a ""villain,"" and he isn't joking. He begins to fight with Iachimo for everything that has happened."
Cymbeline,27,16,"In the hustle and bustle of it all, Posthumus accidently hits Imogen, who had come between him and Iachimo. Uh-oh."
Cymbeline,27,17,"Everyone is worried. Pisanio goes to help Imogen, but she smacks him out of the way. ""He gave me poison!"" she proclaims."
Cymbeline,27,18,Pisanio tells Imogen the truth: the Queen gave it to him.
Cymbeline,27,19,"Cornelius steps up and admits he made the potion. He didn't fess up to it before, because he was afraid of being punished."
Cymbeline,27,20,"Ah… that makes sense, Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus tell one another. Imogen sees her long-lost cave friends and hugs them."
Cymbeline,27,21,Cymbeline and Imogen share a tearful reunion. Cymbeline apologizes for the wicked stepmother he brought into his daughter's life.
Cymbeline,27,22,"Then Imogen and the three hunters-turned-knights tell everyone what happened with Cloten. Uh-oh: that's a problem, because that means Guiderius killed a prince. What's the big whoop? Well, if you kill a prince, you've gotta die."
Cymbeline,27,23,"""Wait,"" says Belarius. ""Remember that lord a while back called Belarius?"""
Cymbeline,27,24,"""Yeah, he was a traitor,"" says Cymbeline. ""Why?"""
Cymbeline,27,25,"""Well, I am Belarius,"" says Belarius. ""Did I not mention that before? Whoops."""
Cymbeline,27,26,"There's lots of details to fill in, but after a short speech, everyone seems to understand. This guy is Belarius, and he kidnapped the princes and raised them for the past twenty years."
Cymbeline,27,27,Cymbeline is overcome with happiness: his long-lost sons have returned. He forgets about the whole kidnapping thing and welcomes them all—even Belarius—with open arms.
Cymbeline,27,28,"Imogen celebrates. She thinks about how funny it is that they all called each other ""brother"" back in the cave, and it turns out they actually were siblings the whole time."
Cymbeline,27,29,Then there's another matter to clear up: the Roman soldiers. What's to be done with these jokers?
Cymbeline,27,30,"Iachimo offers Posthumus his service. Instead of going all rage-aholic on Iachimo again, Posthumus tells the dude to treat other people better. What did you think this was, a tragedy? It's all forgive-and-forget in Shakespearean romance."
Cymbeline,27,31,Posthumus calls the Soothsayer forward because he wants his dream interpreted.
Cymbeline,27,32,"The Soothsayer comes forward and spells it all out for everyone. The cedar is Cymbeline. He now reaches out, and his branches (his children) have been restored to him. Imogen and Posthumus are reunited. So that takes the family tree to a new level. So, basically, Britain will live and prosper. No, really, that's what the oracle means."
Cymbeline,27,33,Cymbeline couldn't be happier. Nothing can put a damper on his mood. He even decides to send the Romans home without punishment—and he promises to pay the tribute from now on.
Cymbeline,26,0,"In the stocks, Posthumus talks of his fate. He just wants to die for what he's done; he doesn't mind being in prison."
Cymbeline,26,1,"Posthumus decides to speak to Imogen alone by falling asleep. Um, okay."
Cymbeline,26,2,"Then it gets weird. A bunch of ghosts visit Posthumus in prison. They're the ghosts of his dead father, mother, and brothers. They circle around him as he sleeps."
Cymbeline,26,3,"Posthumus's dead family knows he has done a great service to his country, but they think it's unfair that he's had to go through so much: banishment, trickery, false imprisonment, you name it."
Cymbeline,26,4,"Posthumus's family feels for him: he's valiant and brave, and he's been wronged again and again."
Cymbeline,26,5,"So the ghosts ask Jupiter, king of the gods, to grieve with them and take pity on Posthumus. What else is there to do?"
Cymbeline,26,6,"Then Jupiter himself descends into the prison cell on the back of an eagle. He's got thunderbolts and lighting. No, really: he does."
Cymbeline,26,7,"The ghosts fall to their knees and listen to Jupiter. He's annoyed by these spirits: surely this isn't worth his time, right?"
Cymbeline,26,8,Jupiter tells the ghosts that he sympathizes with Posthumus and will help him.
Cymbeline,26,9,Posthumus wakes up and thinks about his dream. He reads an oracle on the ground: it talks about a lion's whelp and a stately cedar.
Cymbeline,26,10,"Posthumus is really, really confused at this point. (And frankly, so are we.) He figures it's all just part of a weird dream."
Cymbeline,26,11,"The guards enter and talk about how Posthumus will soon be executed. One of the guards says something like, ""Chin up: at least you don't have to pay any more bar tabs."" Gee, that's a relief."
Cymbeline,26,12,Posthumus doesn't care. He tells the guards he'd rather die than live.
Cymbeline,26,13,"Just in the nick of time, a messenger enters. Cymbeline has requested to see Posthumus."
Cymbeline,26,14,"Once everyone else is gone, the jailer tells us he's never known a prisoner to care less about staying alive."
Cymbeline,1,0,"The Queen, Imogen, and Posthumus show up, and things are tense. Posthumus knows his new dad-in-law has just banished him."
Cymbeline,1,1,"The Queen promises Imogen and Posthumus that she'll talk to Cymbeline for them. She's not an evil stepmother, after all, right? She also lets the lovers have a little privacy so that they can say goodbye."
Cymbeline,1,2,"Once the Queen is gone, Imogen calls her a faker. She's just pretending to be nice, Imogen says. There's lots of tears and sadness. Imogen and Posthumus don't want to leave each other, but they promise they'll write."
Cymbeline,1,3,"The Queen reappears and tells the lovers to break it up: the King is coming. Then, in an aside, she tells the audience that she's really just pretending to be friends with her stepdaughter. Behind her back, she's fooling Cymbeline into taking her side over his daughter's."
Cymbeline,1,4,"Posthumus and Imogen say one last goodbye, but not before giving each other some trinkets. He gets a ring, and she gets a bracelet to remind them of their love for one another even when they are apart. Aww. They promise to be faithful and never, ever, take their gifts off. Ever."
Cymbeline,1,5,"Cymbeline enters and is pretty ticked off at his daughter. How could she do this to him? How dare she? There are lots of angry words between them, but Imogen defends herself against her dad's fuming words."
Cymbeline,1,6,"Even though the Queen begs her hubby to reconsider, Cymbeline locks Imogen up and throws away the key."
Cymbeline,1,7,"Just then, Pisanio, Posthumus's servant enters with news of his master. As Posthumus was leaving, Cloten saw him and threw a couple punches. Luckily, the men walked the other way before anyone was seriously hurt."
Cymbeline,1,8,Imogen wishes the men had fought till the death so that the whole thing could be over.
Cymbeline,1,9,"Pisanio offers his services to Imogen since Posthumus is now exiled. She accepts his offer, as long as he can go see her hubby abroad."
Cymbeline,0,0,Two British guys enter and start dishing to each other about what's going on with their king. The big news is that his daughter Imogen has married Posthumus. Gasp.
Cymbeline,0,1,"Nothing is really wrong with Posthumus, exactly. He's poor, but he's a good guy. He was orphaned as a kid, and King Cymbeline took him under his wing. He never imagined his daughter would marry the guy."
Cymbeline,0,2,"The problem is that the king already picked Cloten to marry Imogen. It turns out Cymbeline got hitched not that long ago himself, and he wants his daughter to marry his wife's son from her first marriage."
Cymbeline,0,3,"Brain Snack: In Shakespeare's England, parents really liked to pick out their kids' spouses. Sometimes, parents even filed lawsuits to try to force their kids into arranged marriages."
Cymbeline,0,4,"These British guys fill us in on the family history so we're up to speed. Cymbeline's two sons were kidnapped twenty years ago, when they were little kids. No one knows what happened to them."
Cymbeline,0,5,"It's pretty sad, the men think, that Cymbeline is fighting with the only child he has left. He's put her in prison for marrying Posthumus and banished Posthumus to boot."
Cymbeline,19,0,"Cloten enters, alone, dressed in Posthumus's clothes, near Belarius's cave. He congratulates himself on his brilliant plan. There's a lot of ""Wow, I'm amazing"" happening here."
Cymbeline,19,1,"Cloten's pretty sure that no matter what he does to Imogen, he won't get in trouble. His mom controls the king, after all."
Cymbeline,19,2,Cloten comes upon the meeting place and hopes Pisanio hasn't lied to him.
Cymbeline,18,0,"In a Roman square, senators and tribunes gather.They want to know who will fight to Rome against Britain."
Cymbeline,18,1,"Since Lucius is the general, many men want to sign up right away. We're betting this means Lucius is a pretty honorable guy."
Cymbeline,13,0,"In the woods in Wales, Belarius tells Guiderius and Arviragus to worship the sun and the heavens."
Cymbeline,13,1,"Wait, who are these dudes? Don't worry—you haven't missed anything. We're just meeting these guys now."
Cymbeline,13,2,Belarius tells the young lads to go up to the hill to hunt while he goes on the flat lands.
Cymbeline,13,3,"Guiderius knows Belarius is older and wiser, but sometimes he wants to go somewhere other than the woods. He's bummed that he's ignorant about everywhere else."
Cymbeline,13,4,Arviragus agrees. He wonders what they will even talk about when they are as old as Belarius. They won't have any experiences to share.
Cymbeline,13,5,"Belarius tells Guiderius and Arviragus the city is full of bad people. Then he recounts a time when he lived in the city and Cymbeline loved him. But then people proclaimed him to be a friend of the Romans, and he was banished."
Cymbeline,13,6,"That sucks, Guiderius says, and then he and Arviragus run off to hunt."
Cymbeline,13,7,"Once they are gone, Belarius lets us in on a little secret: Guiderius and Arviragus are actually Cymbeline's sons. No way. Not only does Cymbeline think they're dead, but the boys think they are actually the sons of Belarius."
Cymbeline,13,8,"Belarius tells us that after Cymbeline unjustly banished him, he decided to get back at the king by kidnapping his boys. He goes by the name Morgan now, and he's raised Guiderius and Arviragus ever since he kidnapped them."
Cymbeline,13,9,"And by the way, Belarius has renamed the heir (that would be Guiderius) Polydore and his younger brother (Arviragus) Cadwal. Just to repeat: the boys' real names are Guiderius and Arviragus, but Belarius—who goes by the name ""Morgan""—calls them Polydore and Cadwal."
Cymbeline,13,10,"Great names, huh?"
Cymbeline,12,0,"Mail call: Pisanio reads a letter aloud to us from Posthumus. In it, his master accuses Imogen of adultery."
Cymbeline,12,1,"Pisanio can't believe it, but he follows his master's orders. He's supposed to deliver a letter to Imogen with instructions for her to leave the palace. Then he's supposed to murder her."
Cymbeline,12,2,Yup. It just got real.
Cymbeline,12,3,"Well, Imogen walks right in. She's excited at the news that a letter has come from her husband. She reads that she is supposed to meet him in Cambria at Milford-Haven (in Wales). She can't believe it; she can't want to see him again."
Cymbeline,12,4,Pisanio and Imogen decide that that Imogen will need to pretend she is sick. She'll retreat to her room so no one will notice she's gone.
Cymbeline,20,0,"Inside Belarius's cave, the three hunters and Imogen talk. Belarius declares that Imogen doesn't look well."
Cymbeline,20,1,"Guiderius and Arviragus also express their concern, but Imogen urges them to go out, anyway."
Cymbeline,20,2,"The boys call Imogen ""brother"" and wish her well. Then, they wonder why they are more devoted to her than to their own father. After all, they've only known her a short time. Or have they?"
Cymbeline,20,3,"Belarius hears this and starts to worry. He knows he's not the boys' real father, and he thinks they might find that out soon."
Cymbeline,20,4,"Imogen feels comforted. She remembers that she has the potion from Pisanio, and she takes it. She goes into the cave to sleep while the men go out to hunt."
Cymbeline,20,5,"Just then, Cloten enters, muttering about how he's trying to find some ""runagates"" (fugitives). He means Imogen and Posthumus, of course, but Guiderius thinks the slur is about them."
Cymbeline,20,6,"There's some trash talk between Cloten and the boys. Cloten thinks he can fight just about anybody, and Guiderius doesn't back down."
Cymbeline,20,7,"The men fight, and it's not long before Guiderius emerges with Cloten's head. He showed that fool."
Cymbeline,20,8,"Arviragus is impressed with his bro, but Belarius fears the worst. He recognizes the Queen's son and wonders if Cymbeline and the Queen know that Guiderius and Arviragus are still alive."
Cymbeline,20,9,Belarius and the boys decide they've had enough excitement for the day. Belarius says they'll return to the cave and bring Imogen some dinner.
Cymbeline,20,10,"Belarius and the boys discover that Imogen is dead. (We know she has just taken the magic potion, but they don't know that.)"
Cymbeline,20,11,"Guiderius and Arviragus are deeply saddened. They decide to lay the body next to the grave of Euripile, their mom—or, you know, the lady they think is their mom."
Cymbeline,20,12,"Guiderius and Arviragus place flowers around Imogen. They want to sing but can't bring themselves to do it, so they speak the words of a song for her. Belarius brings Cloten's body in and lays it next to Imogen."
Cymbeline,20,13,"After the men leave, Imogen awakes and sees Cloten's dead body next to her. She recognizes Posthumus's clothes and mourns the death of her husband. Then she figures out she must have been given a potion by Pisanio instead of medicine."
Cymbeline,20,14,"Oh, that tricky Pisanio, she thinks: he must have been in cahoots with Cloten all along. She falls on Cloten's body."
Cymbeline,20,15,"Just then, a Captain, a Soothsayer, and Lucius enter. They think that Cloten and Imogen are dead, but then Imogen arises."
Cymbeline,20,16,Imogen—still disguised as a boy—offers her services to Lucius. The Roman ambassador accepts; he likes Imogen immediately.
Cymbeline,20,17,Lucius tells Imogen that he'd rather be like a mentor than a master to her.
Cymbeline,21,0,"Back at the palace, Cymbeline asks for a report on his wife. It seems that the Queen became sick after her son left. Cymbeline thinks it's just because Cloten is gone."
Cymbeline,21,1,"Cymbeline threatens to torture Pisanio in order to get news on Cloten's disappearance. Luckily, a lord steps in and confirms that Pisanio was there with him the day Cloten went missing."
Cymbeline,21,2,"Fair enough, says Cymbeline, but what should he do about the Roman invasion? With his stepson detained, he's not sure what he should do."
Cymbeline,21,3,"The counselors tell Cymbeline that he's already ready for war, so he should just go through with it."
Cymbeline,21,4,Cymbeline agrees and departs.
Cymbeline,21,5,"Alone on stage, Pisanio thinks aloud. He says it's weird that he hasn't heard anything from Imogen or from his master. He wrote to Posthumus saying that Imogen was dead, but he hasn't heard back."
Cymbeline,6,0,"Imogen sits alone in her room and feels sorry for herself. For those keeping track, she has a cruel dad, a fake stepmother, a foolish suitor, and a banished husband. Her life sucks."
Cymbeline,6,1,"Pisanio enters with Iachimo—and, more importantly, with a letter from her beloved Posthumus."
Cymbeline,6,2,Imogen is excited to get the letter and welcomes Iachimo for bringing it.
Cymbeline,6,3,"Iachimo is floored by Imogen's hotness. He didn't see that coming; in fact, he's worried that if this woman is as smart as she is pretty, he'll lose the bet."
Cymbeline,6,4,"But Iachimo doesn't give up that easily. He compliments Imogen, but she doesn't seem to care, so he sends Pisanio away to tend to his own servant."
Cymbeline,6,5,"Iachimo figures that if he's alone with Imogen, he can entice her."
Cymbeline,6,6,"Imogen asks about Posthumus. She wants to know about his health and his demeanor, and she wants to know how he's holding up in exile."
Cymbeline,6,7,"Iachimo's all like, ""Oh, he's holding up all right. And then some."" He says Posthumus isn't sad at all; in fact, he's having loads of fun... a little too much fun with the ladies, if you catch his drift."
Cymbeline,6,8,"Imogen doesn't believe it at first, but then she feels sad and tells Iachimo to stop. She doesn't want to hear any more."
Cymbeline,6,9,This is exactly what Iachimo wants. He tells the princess she should get back at her husband for forgetting about her so quickly.
Cymbeline,6,10,Imogen doesn't follow. How's she going to get her revenge?
Cymbeline,6,11,"Iachimo is more direct this time. He tells Imogen that he dedicates himself to her ""sweet pleasure""—in other words, he'll sacrifice himself so that she can get back at Posthumus in the cruelest way. How noble of him."
Cymbeline,6,12,"Imogen is horrified. She calls Iachimo out on his schemes to sleep with her. He's not honorable at all: he's no better than a ""saucy stranger,"" she says, and she condemns him. Boo-ya."
Cymbeline,6,13,"There's nothing left for Iachimo to do but agree with Imogen: he tells her she is the most virtuous woman he's ever met. Oh, and that whole ruse to get her into bed? That was a test, of course. He was trying to seduce her to see if she was honest. Right."
Cymbeline,6,14,"Luckily, Iachimo says, Imogen passed the test."
Cymbeline,6,15,"Imogen finally accepts the apology, after loads of excessive begging from Iachimo."
Cymbeline,6,16,"Iachimo tells Imogen that he is in business with her husband and a bunch of other men. Together, he says, they've pooled their money to buy some lavish gifts for the emperor. There's just one problem: they need somewhere safe to store them."
Cymbeline,6,17,"Imogen says she'll take care of them. Iachimo is relieved. The gifts are in a trunk, and he's worried that the jewels are so valuable that people will want to steal them."
Cymbeline,6,18,"Imogen tells Iachimo not to worry: she won't let the trunk out of her sight. In fact, she'll store the trunk in her bedchamber so that no one else can touch it."
Cymbeline,6,19,Iachimo thinks this is an excellent idea.
Cymbeline,6,20,"We're not exactly sure what the whole trunk business is about, since we know Posthumus and Iachimo haven't bought any grand gifts for the emperor. What we are sure of is that Iachimo is up to something."
Cymbeline,7,0,"Poor Cloten. He's in the palace bowling with two lords and complaining about his life. He has the worst luck of anyone alive, he says."
Cymbeline,7,1,"The lords agree with everything Cloten says, but behind his back, they're making fun of him: what an idiot; he's got no wit; he's a fool, a ""capon"" (idiot), a sucker. We think you get the idea."
Cymbeline,7,2,"The conversation turns to an Italian who has just come to town. (That would be Iachimo). Cloten lost to him at bowls, but he's sure he'll win tonight."
Cymbeline,7,3,"As Cloten and the first lord leave, the second lord stays behind to share some thoughts with the audience. In case we didn't catch on, he says he thinks Cloten is just about the stupidest guy he's ever met."
Cymbeline,7,4,"The second lord is shocked that the ""crafty devil"" Queen has a son who has such a small brain. Then he thinks of poor Imogen, who has to endure a dumb suitor and a father governed by a wicked stepmother."
Cymbeline,14,0,"Imogen and Pisanio have made it to Wales, but there's no sign of Posthumus."
Cymbeline,14,1,Imogen wonders why Pisano is sad and asks him to explain what's happening.
Cymbeline,14,2,"Pisanio comes clean. He declares he's a wretched man for going along with Posthumus's plan, and he gives her the letter to see for herself what's up."
Cymbeline,14,3,"Imogen reads her husband's letter: in it, her calls her a ""strumpet"" and calls for revenge. Pisanio says he doesn't even need to use his sword to kill her, because the letter has already. Yikes."
Cymbeline,14,4,"We totally feel for Imogen, who starts going over why Posthumus might accuse her of such ugly deeds. She blabbers on and on and on about how she's remained chaste while he's been having the time of his life in Italy... according to Iachimo."
Cymbeline,14,5,"Suddenly the other half of the letter dawns on Imogen. It instructs Pisanio to lead her to Milford-Haven and kill her there. And here they are in Milford-Haven, so..."
Cymbeline,14,6,Imogen confronts Pisanio and tells him to get on with it.
Cymbeline,14,7,"But Pisanio has something else in mind: he says he'd rather pull his own eyeballs out before killing Imogen. Since we don't see him doing that anytime soon, we better listen to his plan."
Cymbeline,14,8,"Pisanio has figured out that ""some villain"" must have dragged Imogen's name through the mud. Why else would Posthumus suddenly accuse her of cheating on him?"
Cymbeline,14,9,"Pisanio figures that if Imogen could go to Posthumus and talk to him face-to-face, the two lovebirds could figure it out. Luckily, Lucius (the Roman ambassador) is passing through Milford-Haven on his way back to Rome tomorrow."
Cymbeline,14,10,"If Imogen disguises herself as a boy, she might be able to serve Lucius and hitch a ride to Rome. Pisanio has even brought a set of doublet and hose—boy's clothes—for her to wear."
Cymbeline,14,11,"As a parting gift, Pisanio gives Imogen a box with a special potion in it. The Queen gave it to him (back in Act 1, Scene 6) and promised that it would cure any sickness. If Imogen gets sick on the journey to Rome, that potion will cure her. Pisanio really believes this and wants to help Imogen."
Cymbeline,15,0,"Lucius meets with Cymbeline and company again, hoping they will reconsider the whole stick-it-to-Rome plan."
Cymbeline,15,1,Cymbeline doesn't reconsider. He boldly tells Lucius that they are going where Britain has never gone before: they are totally not going to pay the tribute.
Cymbeline,15,2,"Lucius wishes this were not the case, but he leaves for Milford-Haven. The Queen likes that they've given Lucius reason to frown."
Cymbeline,15,3,"Cymbeline decides he wants to see his daughter. She hasn't been around much, and she looks at him like he's ""malice"" lately."
Cymbeline,15,4,The Queen says Imogen's been that way since Posthumus's exile.
Cymbeline,15,5,"When the attendant returns with news that Imogen's chamber doors were locked, Cymbeline grows suspicious. The Queen says she went to see her before and was told that Imogen was sick."
Cymbeline,15,6,Cymbeline rushes out to find Imogen.
Cymbeline,15,7,Cloten then chimes in with an observation that he hasn't seen Imogen or her servant Pisanio in two days. The Queen orders her son to follow the king.
Cymbeline,15,8,"Alone on stage, the Queen dishes. She doesn't really care where Imogen and Pisanio are, but she realizes that if Imogen is gone, then she, the Queen,is totally in charge of the British crown."
Cymbeline,15,9,That's a total win for the Queen.
Cymbeline,15,10,"Cloten returns with a bombshell: Imogen has taken off. This is good news, says the Queen to herself. Then she leaves."
Cymbeline,15,11,"Pisanio enters the scene, and Cloten confronts him about Imogen's whereabouts. Pisanio decides to send Cloten on a fool's errand since his mistress has surely left Britain safely by now. He tells Cloten that Imogen has gone to Milford-Haven."
Cymbeline,15,12,"This is the perfect opportunity for Cloten to get his revenge on Imogen for saying that he was worse than Posthumus's clothes. He sends Pisanio to fetch those very clothes. He's going to wear them, and while he's wearing them, he's going to ""ravish"" Imogen and kill Posthumus."
Cymbeline,15,13,He's taking this revenge thing very seriously.
Jude the Obscure,2,0,"Since Christminster hasn't really panned out the way he dreamed it would, Jude has moved on, taking local jobs and trying to figure out his future."
Jude the Obscure,2,1,"Jude doesn't have much left besides his heart, so he makes a plan to move to Melchester, where Sue is attending a teaching school."
Jude the Obscure,2,2,"Jude goes to see Sue. Get used to this. There is a lot of them traveling to see each other and not really acting on their feelings during this portion of the book. It's very Victorian of them, or at least kind of Harry and Sally."
Jude the Obscure,2,3,"Time for another ""wait, is this a date or just dinner?"" moment. Sue and Jude go to an inn together to eat and talk."
Jude the Obscure,2,4,"Sadly, Jude discovers that Sue and Phillotson are engaged. Ouch! That hurts, people. Jude only sees one way of dealing with it: he decides to commit himself to studying Divinity."
Jude the Obscure,2,5,"Sure, Sue is engaged, but Jude is her cousin, so there is no harm in going on an all-night outing with him, right? (The phrase ""kissing cousins,"" which usually just refers to a relative close enough to you to kiss in greeting, suddenly takes on more meaning.)"
Jude the Obscure,2,6,"They find themselves walking for a long time and getting worn out and tired. They stop at a shepherd's house to rest. They realize they will never make the train back to town, so they stay at the shepherd's for the night (in separate rooms, since they make it clear that they are not a married couple)."
Jude the Obscure,2,7,"The next day, Sue goes back to her teaching college. Before they part, she gives him a picture of herself. (Check out some Victorian photos to get an idea of what it might look like. Kind of creepy, right? We bet that Jude prefers his trusty painted portrait of Sue from his aunt's house.)"
Jude the Obscure,2,8,Let the gossip commence! Sue's overnight disappearance causes scandal at the training school where she studies and lives.
Jude the Obscure,2,9,"As punishment, Sue is put in ""solitary""—as though her school is a prison. Not only does this indicate what Victorian schools thought was appropriate punishment for their students (hint: lots of stuff that would in no way fly today), but it also makes us glad that we're getting our educations in the twenty-first century. It's much safer that way!"
Jude the Obscure,2,10,"Revolt time! The girls at the school protest Sue's confinement. This is really bold on their part, but after all, they have had it up to here with the strict rules and stricter behavioral codes they are expected to follow."
Jude the Obscure,2,11,"Not one to deal with annoying things like solitary confinement, Sue climbs out a window, wades through some cold water, and flees the school. (We're liking this girl—she's tough!)"
Jude the Obscure,2,12,"Soaked and chilled to the bone, Sue arrives at Jude's place."
Jude the Obscure,2,13,"To warm up and to hide the fact that she is a woman in a single man's home, she puts on Jude's clothes. (Interested in other classic cross dressing moments in literature? Check out As You Like It, Twelfth Night, and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.)"
Jude the Obscure,2,14,"Jude gives Sue brandy, and Sue rests and tries to get warm."
Jude the Obscure,2,15,"There is nothing quite like waking up after a bone chilling near-death swim to escape solitary confinement at your teaching college to find a lovely meal waiting for you. Seriously, we assume that there is nothing like that, since it's such a weird sequence of events."
Jude the Obscure,2,16,"But anyway, the point is: Sue wakes to find that Jude has had supper brought up to her."
Jude the Obscure,2,17,"It's not surprising that a woman as brilliant, charming, and infuriating as Sue has a bit of a legendary (in the Barney Stinson sense) past. Sue tells Jude about an undergrad friend she once had—a guy."
Jude the Obscure,2,18,"They lived together just as friends, but he wanted more out from the relationship. Sue wasn't willing to take things further with him."
Jude the Obscure,2,19,"Take note: in spite of Sue's supposedly scandalous, freethinking ways, she's not just about the sex at all."
Jude the Obscure,2,20,"The two argue about Christminster. Jude still clings to his ideal of it as a place of beauty, godliness, and learning. Sue disagrees, saying, 'It is a place full of fetichists and ghost-seers!' (3.4.63)."
Jude the Obscure,2,21,"As we know, Sue doesn't care much for religion. (By the way, what's so bad about ghost-seers? We watch Ghost Hunters on a regular basis!)"
Jude the Obscure,2,22,"This time around, Jude doesn't hold back on his feelings for his cousin. He says to Sue, 'You know you are the fairest among women to me' (3.4.82). Sue tells Jude not to say that kind of stuff."
Jude the Obscure,2,23,"They fall asleep. When Jude wakes, he realizes that Sue's garments have finally dried."
Jude the Obscure,2,24,Sue dresses in her woman's clothes again.
Jude the Obscure,2,25,"Things are getting a little awkward. Remember, Sue is still engaged to Phillotson, but she just slept over at Jude's house. It was all perfectly innocent, but … things are clearly weird between them."
Jude the Obscure,2,26,"Sue leaves to visit a friend's sister. Before going, she tells Jude not to love her. Which is harsh, y'all. And obviously impossible."
Jude the Obscure,2,27,"Luckily, Sue writes Jude almost immediately after she arrives at her destination telling Jude he can actually love her. She's changed her mind. Her earlier don't-love-me thing was just a mistake—no worries!"
Jude the Obscure,2,28,"Jude is like, okaaaay, well, good! And he immediately writes a response, but then hears nothing back. Jude starts to worry, so…"
Jude the Obscure,2,29,Jude goes to see Sue (we told you that was going to happen a lot).
Jude the Obscure,2,30,"It turns out that Sue cannot return to the training school, because everyone views her as a scandalous outcast."
Jude the Obscure,2,31,"In fact, the gossips around town have all decided that Jude and Sue are a couple. Many believe they should marry to put an end to the scandal of their unmarried love (remember, that's basically the same logic that drove Jude to marry Arabella when she was ""knocked up"")."
Jude the Obscure,2,32,"Of course, Sue brushes it off, because clearly they're not a couple, right? I mean, they just spend a lot of time together, confide in each other, and occasionally sleep in the same room. There's nothing special about that!"
Jude the Obscure,2,33,Sue says she will return to Phillotson to calm the gossip.
Jude the Obscure,2,34,"Things get a little testy between the two before Jude leaves. Luckily, Sue writes another letter to ask his forgiveness and to set up a meeting before she leaves Melchester. Who knew that writing letters could be such an effective way to take back everything someone has just said in person? It's like a Get Out of Jail Free card for Victorian times!"
Jude the Obscure,2,35,"Watch out, surprise POV shift! For the first time, we're getting some direct insight into poor Phillotson, the totally unknowing third party in this weird, adulterous love square we have going on in this novel."
Jude the Obscure,2,36,"Phillotson dreams of marrying Sue, and he does his best to build a life in which he will be able to support the two of them."
Jude the Obscure,2,37,"It turns out that Sue has wanted to keep the engagement secret, and has said that they won't marry until after she has completed her teacher's training."
Jude the Obscure,2,38,"Again, this is a Bad Sign: secret engagements might sound romantic, but if only one person wants to keep the secret, you may have a Glee-style Emma Pillsbury/Ken Tanaka situation."
Jude the Obscure,2,39,"Channeling his inner romance, Phillotson arrives at the training school unannounced to surprise the woman he loves."
Jude the Obscure,2,40,He had no idea Sue had been expelled. Oops.
Jude the Obscure,2,41,"As is often the case in novels like this, chance plays an important role. By chance, Phillotson runs into Jude."
Jude the Obscure,2,42,"Watch as Jude quickly inserts foot into mouth. Jude tells Phillotson he wishes he could marry Sue, but then tries lamely to play it off as a joke. You know, he just means he wants to marry someone—anyone at all, not Sue in particular, ha ha!—and settle down instead of 'living in lodgings here and there' (3.6.22)."
Jude the Obscure,2,43,Jude tells Phillotson that Sue is innocent of any scandal.
Jude the Obscure,2,44,"Okay, you might have forgotten at this point that Jude is actually still legally married to Arabella. Just because she's in Australia does not make their marriage license null and void."
Jude the Obscure,2,45,The fact that you guys know this puts you one up on Sue: she still has no idea until Jude finally tells her.
Jude the Obscure,2,46,"Sue cries. Jude tries to touch her, but she rejects him."
Jude the Obscure,2,47,"They part as ""friends."" Yeah, just what you want to hear from the woman you love."
Jude the Obscure,2,48,"Another letter arrives from Sue, with a special gut punch meant just for Jude. This one informs Jude that Sue and Phillotson are getting married soon. Sue asks if Jude will give her away. (We have to say, our jaws dropped at this fabulous idea of Sue's.)"
Jude the Obscure,2,49,"For reasons beyond our understanding, Jude agrees to give Sue away and to host her while she prepares for the ceremony. In order to make this work, Jude moves into a bigger place."
Jude the Obscure,2,50,"So here's a good idea: why don't we kind of live together for a while, even though I'm marrying someone else and you're already married to yet another person. That sounds perfect and not at all likely to get the gossips' tongues wagging."
Jude the Obscure,2,51,Sue comes to stay in Jude's house ten days before the wedding.
Jude the Obscure,2,52,They eat a pre-wedding breakfast together and instantly regret the decision. It's just not smart to dine with the guy you actually love on the day you're planning to marry someone else.
Jude the Obscure,2,53,"In one of her flights of fancy, Sue decides that they should check out the church where the wedding is taking place."
Jude the Obscure,2,54,She and Jude walk arm-in-arm down the aisle. Jude realizes that 'She does not realize what marriage means!' (3.7.28).
Jude the Obscure,2,55,"Yeah, and she also doesn't seem to realize that she's driving herself and especially Jude totally nuts."
Jude the Obscure,2,56,"As luck would have it, they run into Phillotson when they leave the church."
Jude the Obscure,2,57,"Eventually, they leave for the actual wedding. Jude gives her a gift of tulle (a kind of lightweight netted fabric)."
Jude the Obscure,2,58,Sue says she left something back at the house. Jude goes with her.
Jude the Obscure,2,59,"Sue is just about to say something to Jude—but she doesn't quite. (Aaaaagh! Hardy, you fiend! Why don't they ever say what they need to say?!)"
Jude the Obscure,2,60,"Even though Jude watches Sue and Phillotson get married, he still feels that it can't really have happened. He believes that she will come back to him. Ah, he's probably right—surely these nice people deserve a happily-ever-after. (Though we'll tell you now, what they deserve and what Hardy's going to give them are two totally different things. Sigh.)"
Jude the Obscure,2,61,"Luckily, that sick aunt is around to bring these cousins back together. Jude returns to see her. She's not doing well. He informs Sue."
Jude the Obscure,2,62,"Like any good niece, Sue says she will come."
Jude the Obscure,2,63,"The day and time for her arrival is set, and Jude goes to meet her."
Jude the Obscure,2,64,"As Jude often does in times of confusion, he returns to Christminster."
Jude the Obscure,2,65,"Apparently, he will never learn: that city is just no good for him."
Jude the Obscure,2,66,"Once back in the city, of course he goes drinking."
Jude the Obscure,2,67,"And cue the ominous music: Arabella works at the bar as a waitress! Remember her? Jude's wife who tricked him into marrying her and then left him for a voyage to Australia? Well, she's back. It's like something out of Poltergeist 2 (Come on, guys, who doesn't love bad horror movie sequels from the mid-'80s?)"
Jude the Obscure,2,68,The still-married Jude and Arabella talk to one another for a bit.
Jude the Obscure,2,69,The couple travels and dines together at an inn.
Jude the Obscure,2,70,"The following morning, we see the two not-so-lovebirds Jude and Arabella traveling back to Christminster together."
Jude the Obscure,2,71,"In case you think Arabella is back to make amends and live together with Jude as husband and wife once more, forget it: Arabella reveals that she married another man while she was in Australia. (It seems like it was easy to get away with things like that in Australia back then.)"
Jude the Obscure,2,72,They part.
Jude the Obscure,2,73,"Jude is deeply confused (and who can blame him, what with the sudden reappearance and disappearance of the woman he married when he was sixteen and then hasn't seen for years?). He's trying to figure out how to handle things."
Jude the Obscure,2,74,"Of course, there is a sick aunt who needs attending. Jude goes to see his aunt and meets Sue along the way. He missed her when she arrived, because he was with Arabella."
Jude the Obscure,2,75,"Together, they go to see their aunt (how convenient that they share aunts, right, guys?), who has undergone a pretty solid recovery."
Jude the Obscure,2,76,Sue admits that she regrets getting married. She cannot say that she loves Phillotson.
Jude the Obscure,2,77,"Before she leaves, Sue tells Jude not to come visit her, once again twisting the knife of heartbreak in his chest."
Jude the Obscure,2,78,"Is that a mixed metaphor? If we're starting to confuse our terms, it's because these two are deeply exhausting. Fascinating, but exhausting."
Jude the Obscure,2,79,"If only a letter would arrive to make things a little easier, to smooth things over a bit—to give Jude a bit of hope. Yes!"
Jude the Obscure,2,80,"For once, Jude gets good news on paper."
Jude the Obscure,2,81,He receives a letter from Arabella.
Jude the Obscure,2,82,She has gone to London to reconnect with her other husband.
Jude the Obscure,2,83,"When all else fails and your confidence is a bit low, here's a tip from Jude Fawley: try to turn yourself into a rock star. Or at least a person who can play a few chords at a party or a church."
Jude the Obscure,2,84,"That's what Jude tries. He learns to sing and play music. He joins a choir, and begins to dedicate himself to the musical side of spiritual practice."
Jude the Obscure,2,85,"Due to this new love, he seeks out a musician who has written a specific piece that he enjoys."
Jude the Obscure,2,86,"Thanks to this visit, he misses a letter from Sue inviting him to come visit."
Jude the Obscure,2,87,"Once Jude reads the letter, he answers (obviously that he will see her)."
Jude the Obscure,2,88,"He tells her he will come see her. Shocking, we know."
Jude the Obscure,2,89,"The music thing threw us for a loop, but when it comes to Sue, Jude is pretty predictable."
Jude the Obscure,2,90,"Whew. Three parts down, three to go. Why not take another little break?Watching this guy jump from space should be a nice change from Victorian England for a bit."
Jude the Obscure,3,0,"New town, same story: the Jude-and-Sue doomed love saga continues. In the classroom at the school where Sue and Phillotson teach, Jude sees the piano that Phillotson left with Jude's aunt back in Part First, Chapter 1, when Phillotson first went to Christminster. Wow, Hardy really keeps an eye on continuity—we're impressed with his attention to detail."
Jude the Obscure,3,1,"If this were a scene in a modern romantic comedy (as opposed to the least comedic romance ever), we'd be in for a piano duet of ""Heart and Soul"" just about now. It's not quite that, but Sue does enter and they do play the piano together."
Jude the Obscure,3,2,"They hold hands. And yes, this is a big deal in 1896."
Jude the Obscure,3,3,"Jude accuses Sue of being a flirt, which she does not take well. It's go time—Sue kicks Jude right out. Until, of course, she changes her mind yet again."
Jude the Obscure,3,4,"As Jude leaves, he watches Sue from a distance. He knows he will go see her again. He can't help himself. In the meantime, he will pray and fast."
Jude the Obscure,3,5,"And the letters from Sue keep coming: this one says that Jude absolutely should not come and see her again. Never! Never, she says! (Sue is not a very decisive lady, we have to say.)"
Jude the Obscure,3,6,"Now, if only there were some family-related incident to bring them together again. Something like—the death of a beloved aunt?"
Jude the Obscure,3,7,"Sue comes to the funeral, and she and Jude are reunited."
Jude the Obscure,3,8,"Not surprisingly, we find out that Sue is unhappy with her marriage to Phillotson."
Jude the Obscure,3,9,"Once again, Sue and Jude spend the night in the same house."
Jude the Obscure,3,10,"And we get another highly frustrating ""will they, won't they"" moment. Hardy's really keeping the UST high between these two; it's like the first season of Castle up in here."
Jude the Obscure,3,11,"Sue breaks down and cries. She lays her head on Jude, kisses his forehead, and then sends him away."
Jude the Obscure,3,12,"Aaaaaaaaaagh! Just get together already, jeez!"
Jude the Obscure,3,13,"Because this is 1896 and holding hands back then seems to be about equivalent to passionate making out today, Sue confesses guiltily to Phillotson that she and Jude held hands."
Jude the Obscure,3,14,"To make matters even worse, she drops this on him: 'Richard…would you mind my living away from you?' (4.3.48) We've got to feel for Phillotson in this scene: that question has to hurt like a kick to the teeth."
Jude the Obscure,3,15,"At first, they simply live apart in the same house. And guess what? To nobody's surprise, that's not going to work out well."
Jude the Obscure,3,16,"Wife sick of you in every possible way? Why not busy yourself with antiquities studies? Yes, that is what Phillotson does."
Jude the Obscure,3,17,"Exhausted one night, Phillotson stumbles into Sue's bedroom."
Jude the Obscure,3,18,"And rather than deal with her husband, Sue screams and jumps out a window. Let us repeat that: rather than spending time with her husband, Sue chooses to jump out a window. Here's another tip for all you Shmoopers out there to consider in the future: if your wife leaps out of a building when you enter her room, probably something is not right in your relationship."
Jude the Obscure,3,19,Phillotson feels like he has no choice any longer. He visits his friend Gillingham and tells him that he thinks letting Sue leave is the right thing to do.
Jude the Obscure,3,20,"Gillingham does not agree, even though it is clear to Phillotson that Sue and Jude 'seem to be one person split in two' (4.4.30)."
Jude the Obscure,3,21,Phillotson is being surprisingly philosophical about this whole business.
Jude the Obscure,3,22,So Phillotson and Sue share their last meal together (at least for now).
Jude the Obscure,3,23,"Finally, it happens. Sue leaves Phillotson."
Jude the Obscure,3,24,Good old Gillingham arrives to help the old schoolmaster through these difficult times.
Jude the Obscure,3,25,"Hardy pulls a little time travel here (and without the help of a DeLorean or a TARDIS, mind you)."
Jude the Obscure,3,26,"We learn that, a day before her departure from Phillotson's house, Sue wrote a letter to Jude telling him she would be coming to him."
Jude the Obscure,3,27,"As the train arrives after Sue has left her husband, Jude waits for Sue. They travel on together. He knows they need to go somewhere where they are not so well known so they can start a new life together."
Jude the Obscure,3,28,"They kiss. And if holding hands is such a huge thing, you can imagine that this scene really seals the nature of their relationship for the readers."
Jude the Obscure,3,29,"It turns out that Sue isn't the only one making a big change as far as marriage goes. Jude tells Sue that he is divorcing Arabella. (We're going to take just one second for a history fact check here: divorces may be pretty easy to get now, but back in 1896, it still carried a huge social stigma."
Jude the Obscure,3,30,"The fact that people could even get legally divorced in Britain without the Church getting involved was still a pretty new thing at the end of the nineteenth century, thanks to the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857.)"
Jude the Obscure,3,31,"Even though they plan to live together, Sue makes it totally clear that she does not want to have a sexual relationship with Jude."
Jude the Obscure,3,32,"Jude is not totally glad to hear this, but he respects Sue's decision."
Jude the Obscure,3,33,"They end up at the inn where Jude stayed with Arabella in Part Third, Chapter 8."
Jude the Obscure,3,34,"Sue gets very angry about this, but Jude talks her down, and they make up."
Jude the Obscure,3,35,"Meanwhile, the school realizes that Sue has disappeared. Phillotson tells the truth about his wife's departure, believing he did the honorable thing in letting her go. The school disagrees, and they try to force him to resign. (What?! Firing a guy because his wife just left him? Can't anybody catch a break in this novel? 1896 sounds like the worst non-medieval time ever.)"
Jude the Obscure,3,36,"Soon, Phillotson is fired. During the town meeting that leads to his dismissal, a fight breaks out between those that agree with his decision and those who don't. (Clearly, there are a lot of repressed emotions and cultural conflicts developing around this issue of marriage.)"
Jude the Obscure,3,37,"The stress of it all causes Phillotson to fall ill. Good old Gillingham arrives to help, and he sends a letter to Sue to let her know that Phillotson isn't feeling so hot."
Jude the Obscure,3,38,"Sue arrives and nurses Phillotson for a bit. In a way, they make up, but it is clear that she doesn't want to be his wife. Sue also tells him that she and Jude have not been physically intimate in any way."
Jude the Obscure,3,39,"Despite being kind of dull, Phillotson is an honorable guy. He decides he should grant Sue a divorce."
Jude the Obscure,5,0,"O, Christminster, we knew we'd see you again. You appeared in the first part, so we were sure you would appear in the last as well."
Jude the Obscure,5,1,"And here you are. Anyway, Jude takes the family to Christminster on Remembrance Day—the day when all the Doctoral students graduate from the colleges. (Why does Jude keep doing this kind of stuff to himself? Does he love misery, or what?)"
Jude the Obscure,5,2,This is the perfect opportunity for Jude to tell his tale to some of the people he once knew—saying that society will not accept a self-taught man.
Jude the Obscure,5,3,Jude announces: 'I'm an outsider to the end of my days!' (6.1.51)
Jude the Obscure,5,4,"Guess who else happens to be in the crowd? Yep, old man Phillotson."
Jude the Obscure,5,5,Having kids can make things tough on a family looking for a place to stay. Sue and Jude struggle to find lodging.
Jude the Obscure,5,6,"And Sue is pregnant again, making everything even more difficult."
Jude the Obscure,5,7,"The only solution is to break up the band for a while. Sue and the children take one room, but Jude must find lodging elsewhere."
Jude the Obscure,5,8,"Sue tells the landlady that she and Jude are not really married. (Why, Sue, why?)"
Jude the Obscure,5,9,"This does not go over well, of course. The landlady's husband tells them they will have to leave the following day."
Jude the Obscure,5,10,"A black cloud of melancholy hangs over the scene like some sort of, well, dense black cloud. Sue is depressed. Little Father Time is depressed."
Jude the Obscure,5,11,All we need is Marvin the Paranoid Android to make a perfect storm of misery in this room.
Jude the Obscure,5,12,Sue tells LFT that it is hard to find lodging with the children.
Jude the Obscure,5,13,"Huge mistake! If that wasn't bad enough, Sue then tells LFT that she is having another baby."
Jude the Obscure,5,14,"Huge, huge mistake!"
Jude the Obscure,5,15,"He doesn't take this well, knowing it will be even more difficult to survive with another child in the family."
Jude the Obscure,5,16,LFT flips out at Sue.
Jude the Obscure,5,17,"In the morning, Sue goes to eat breakfast with Jude at his lodging."
Jude the Obscure,5,18,They return to the place where Sue was staying with the children. There is no noise. The kids must be sleeping.
Jude the Obscure,5,19,"Oh, if only the kids were sleeping."
Jude the Obscure,5,20,Sue and Jude find the two babies and Little Father Time hanging by box chords.
Jude the Obscure,5,21,"Little Father Time has killed the babies and himself. His note simply reads, 'Done because we are too menny.' (6.2.40)"
Jude the Obscure,5,22,"The funeral is held, but Jude goes without Sue."
Jude the Obscure,5,23,"Later, Sue tries to stop the man from burying the children. She wants to see them again."
Jude the Obscure,5,24,"It takes all of his strength, but Jude gets Sue away from the cemetery."
Jude the Obscure,5,25,"Sue miscarries. Yes, this book has gotten incredibly depressing really fast. Sorry, everyone."
Jude the Obscure,5,26,"There's really no way for them to come back from what has happened, but Sue tries to recover, both physically and mentally."
Jude the Obscure,5,27,"As Jude goes back to work on his stonemasonry, Sue turns more and more to religion, reversing many of her earlier opinions about rigid Christian morality."
Jude the Obscure,5,28,"Finally, Sue says she will never marry Jude, and that she still belongs to Phillotson."
Jude the Obscure,5,29,"At this point, you might get angry and yell at the book for completely crushing your hopes for these people. This does not mean you are crazy. This just means that Hardy is a brilliant writer and a complete jerk to his readers. We admire him even as he hurts us so much."
Jude the Obscure,5,30,"Just when things surely can't get any worse, Arabella shows up. Oh honestly, what now?"
Jude the Obscure,5,31,"Sue proves that she has really changed by announcing that Jude still belongs to Arabella morally speaking, despite their perfectly legal and justifiable divorce."
Jude the Obscure,5,32,Sue then kicks Jude out of their house.
Jude the Obscure,5,33,"They share a last kiss, and then she pushes him away. AAAAAAAARGH!"
Jude the Obscure,5,34,"There is really nothing uplifting to say about the awful turn that these characters' lives have taken, except maybe to be thankful that at least no one gets eaten alive by rats."
Jude the Obscure,5,35,"This actually happens in Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel The Jungle. If possible, The Jungle is even grimmer than Jude the Obscure, which is obviously really saying something."
Jude the Obscure,5,36,"Clearly, the decade from 1896 to 1906 was a very dark time for literature."
Jude the Obscure,5,37,"The schemer is at the top of her game now: Arabella meets with Phillotson and sets her plan—presumably called ""Operation Get Jude Back at Any Cost Because I Am Completely Insane""—in motion."
Jude the Obscure,5,38,Guess what? Sue goes to see Jude to tell him that she is going to remarry Phillotson. She suggests that he should take back Arabella.
Jude the Obscure,5,39,"Once again, Jude and Sue part ways. Seriously, how is it possible for a book to keep twisting our hearts so very much?"
Jude the Obscure,5,40,"Surprise, surprise: there are no happy endings here."
Jude the Obscure,5,41,"Sue returns to Phillotson. She tells him that all of her children have died as a judgment on her for having them while living in sin with Jude. (Oh, Sue. No.)"
Jude the Obscure,5,42,"While Phillotson is glad to have Sue back, he is upset to see that she still pulls away from him physically."
Jude the Obscure,5,43,"Sue blames the weather and a sudden feeling of cold for her shudder away from him, but it's clear that there are still Issues between the two."
Jude the Obscure,5,44,"In a final act of purging her previous ""adulterous"" (6.5.29) life, Sue destroys a beautiful nightgown she had bought to impress Jude."
Jude the Obscure,5,45,The widow Mrs. Edlin tries to convince Sue not to marry Phillotson again.
Jude the Obscure,5,46,"She also tells Sue that it's sinful to use religion to claim that her children should never have been born. (Sue, please, pretty please—listen to the widow! She's right on both counts!)"
Jude the Obscure,5,47,"Of course, Sue doesn't listen (when does she ever?), and Sue and Phillotson remarry."
Jude the Obscure,5,48,"However, Phillotson says he will not 'intrude on [Sue's] personal privacy' (6.5.80). While Phillotson says he's not remarrying Sue for social reasons, he does admit that the main reason they should remarry is to repair their public reputations. How romantic."
Jude the Obscure,5,49,"Wouldn't you know it, Arabella shows up at Jude's."
Jude the Obscure,5,50,She claims to have left her father's home without a penny after he called her lazy one too many times.
Jude the Obscure,5,51,Jude gives Arabella money for the train and tells her to get him news of Sue and Phillotson.
Jude the Obscure,5,52,"When she returns, Arabella tracks Jude down at a bar."
Jude the Obscure,5,53,"Arabella confirms that Sue and Phillotson have remarried, but that the whole ceremony was quite sad."
Jude the Obscure,5,54,"Apparently, Mrs. Edlin has been quite open in sharing Sue's view that she has to be with Phillotson no matter what her own feelings might be, because God is demanding it of her."
Jude the Obscure,5,55,She proceeds to get him seriously drunk and takes him to her father's house.
Jude the Obscure,5,56,"Well, we can all see the writing on the wall: with the whole pregnancy scam thing in Part First, we've already seen that Arabella is going to make things happen once she's set her mind to it."
Jude the Obscure,5,57,She sends for Jude's belongings and has them brought to her father's house.
Jude the Obscure,5,58,"Knowing that Jude can't really stand her, Arabella pretty much keeps Jude drunk for days to confuse him and then informs him that he promised to marry her."
Jude the Obscure,5,59,"When he says he has no memory of that, Arabella and her father band together to question Jude's honor. No good can happen when Jude feels that his honor is being questioned."
Jude the Obscure,5,60,"Drunk, Jude and Arabella remarry. Brutal. Just—beyond brutal."
Jude the Obscure,5,61,"Death is pretty much the only escape for Jude at this point. His body seems to agree that this stuff can't go on, because Jude gets very sick."
Jude the Obscure,5,62,"He and Arabella fight constantly. Arabella scolds Jude for getting too sick and making her support him in their marriage (which is rich, given that she had to get him drunk to marry him at all.) Seriously, people, can you think of any novel villain who is as awful as Arabella without having actually, y'know, murdered someone?"
Jude the Obscure,5,63,"In one last attempt to experience any sort of joy, Jude asks Arabella to send for Sue. Of course, Arabella refuses. Jude physically attacks her and threatens to kill her, which is definite proof of how far the once-honorable and gentle Jude has fallen."
Jude the Obscure,5,64,But he lets up before he truly hurts her.
Jude the Obscure,5,65,"Lying is like second nature to Arabella, so she says she will send a letter to Sue."
Jude the Obscure,5,66,"Surprise, surprise—she never does. Because we've all come to trust Arabella's word so much up until now, right?"
Jude the Obscure,5,67,"Jude sneaks out of the house and braves the rain and sleet to go see Sue one more time—because what is cold or sleet or even Death itself to a man in love? (At least, that's what romance novels teach us.)"
Jude the Obscure,5,68,Jude and Sue meet for the last time in a church.
Jude the Obscure,5,69,Sue really twists the knife here by actually congratulating Jude on doing the right thing by remarrying Arabella.
Jude the Obscure,5,70,"Jude tells her his second marriage is ""degrading, immoral, unnatural"" (6.8.46)—sure proof that Jude, at least, doesn't buy the rightness of Sue's sudden return to rigid marital morality."
Jude the Obscure,5,71,"After some talk, Sue finally rushes and kisses Jude, confessing her love for him once more. (Please, Hardy, just this once, let things work out. Pleeease.)"
Jude the Obscure,5,72,"Nope, it's a no go. Of course. Jude asks Sue to come with him, but she won't. As Jude walks into the rain and sleet, Sue closes her ears so she will not hear him coughing as he walks away."
Jude the Obscure,5,73,"Arabella meets Jude on the train platform just to inform him that he's certainly going to die, now, since the bad weather has ruined his health."
Jude the Obscure,5,74,"Jude agrees, and he's glad of it."
Jude the Obscure,5,75,"At least he's seen Sue one last time. (Once again, we have to wonder what Arabella is getting out of all of this: is it fun for her to watch Jude commit extended suicide by weather?)"
Jude the Obscure,5,76,"As Jude and Arabella walk through the streets of Christminster, Jude looks around at the city he once dreamed of. He can remember his first walk through the city, and now this is the last one."
Jude the Obscure,5,77,All of those great scholars he dreamed of joining seem to be laughing at him now.
Jude the Obscure,5,78,"Meanwhile, back in the agony of Sue and Phillotson's marriage, Sue is talking to Mrs. Edlin about the fact that she just can't seem to sleep with Phillotson. And he's not asking her to—but she feels like she owes him. (Oh god, Sue, why are you punishing yourself like this? Honestly, we wish we could pay for all of these characters to have a nice round of therapy.)"
Jude the Obscure,5,79,"When Phillotson comes home, Sue confesses to him that she has seen Jude."
Jude the Obscure,5,80,"She swears on the Bible that she will never do it again. Phillotson forgives her, and Sue follows him into his room."
Jude the Obscure,5,81,"Sue and Phillotson have sex for the first time since their remarriage. She is repulsed by him and disgusted by the act, but she does it anyway."
Jude the Obscure,5,82,"Jude feels a bit stronger, and even puts in some time working—but his sickness soon comes back, and Arabella can see that it's going to be the last one."
Jude the Obscure,5,83,"Mrs. Edlin comes to see Jude, and Arabella leaves the two of them alone."
Jude the Obscure,5,84,"Jude comes right out and asks if Sue and Phillotson are living ""as husband and wife in name"" (6.10.13)? (In other words, are Sue and Phillotson having sex or what?)"
Jude the Obscure,5,85,"Mrs. Edlin (who seems amazingly observant, we have to say) recognizes that Sue seduced Phillotson right after she last saw Jude, even though she didn't really want to."
Jude the Obscure,5,86,"Jude regrets that his and Sue's ideas were ""fifty years too soon to be any good"" (6.10.16) to them."
Jude the Obscure,5,87,"The doctor arrives and Mrs. Edlin lets him in: it's the old quack, Dr. Vilbert."
Jude the Obscure,5,88,"As Jude lies close to death, Arabella starts making moves on Dr. Vilbert. She gives him a glass of wine and jokes that she's used that old love potion that he sold her in Part Fifth, Chapter 5."
Jude the Obscure,5,89,"As the two of them go off to have sex, Arabella thinks to herself that Jude's about to die anyway, and 'Weak women must provide for a rainy day' (6.10.31). She's extremely practical, that Arabella."
Jude the Obscure,5,90,"Arabella looks at Jude sleeping and tries to figure out how close he is to death. (We can't even say we're shocked at her behavior, anymore—we're just exhausted by Arabella at this point.)"
Jude the Obscure,5,91,"She soon grows impatient just waiting and goes out because she hears the sound of music, leaving Jude to suffer on his own."
Jude the Obscure,5,92,"Dying, Jude calls for water to Arabella—and then to Sue."
Jude the Obscure,5,93,"As he lies in bed, he hears the sounds of the Remembrance Day celebrations from outside, when the Doctoral students at Christminster receive their degrees. It's a bitter sound for poor Jude, considering his lost dreams of scholarship."
Jude the Obscure,5,94,"Arabella arrives at the public celebrations, where everyone is cheerful. A group of men invite her to a boat race with them—as long as she can spare the time from her sick husband?"
Jude the Obscure,5,95,Arabella checks in on Jude before she hits the boating extravaganza. She finds him dead.
Jude the Obscure,5,96,"But hey, a little thing like a dead husband isn't going to stop her from having fun. Annoyed that Jude should choose this horribly inconvenient time to die, Arabella closes the door and tells the men who have invited her that her husband is sleeping, and that her father is looking after him."
Jude the Obscure,5,97,"Arabella goes to the boat race, where she flirts with Dr. Vilbert, while all the while Jude is lying dead in his bed."
Jude the Obscure,5,98,"Two days later, at Jude's funeral, only Arabella and Mrs. Edlin are present."
Jude the Obscure,5,99,"Arabella speaks maybe the first truth she's said in the whole novel, saying of Sue: 'She may swear that [she has found peace] on her knees to the holy cross upon her necklace till she's hoarse, but it won't be true […] She's never found peace since she left his arms, and never will again till she's as he is now!' (6.11.74)."
Jude the Obscure,5,100,"At last, we've hit tragic rock bottom: Jude is dead and Sue is alive but suffering horribly. Sigh—what a long, strange road it's been, right, guys?"
Jude the Obscure,4,0,"Both divorces go through the courts. Technically, Jude and Sue are free! Let the happiness begin, right, guys? Surely it's all fine now—what could possibly go wrong?"
Jude the Obscure,4,1,"In honor of their newfound freedom, Jude and Sue go for a walk together, but they soon start arguing. Sue still feels a deep hatred for the whole institution of marriage."
Jude the Obscure,4,2,"Jude keeps talking about their engagement, but Sue just isn't into it—she feels that, as soon as they are legally matched and have to love each other, they will immediately stop really loving each other."
Jude the Obscure,4,3,"Jude worries that this is all proof that Sue doesn't really love him, since she has never actually come out and said so. But all Sue wants is the freedom to decide how she will live with Jude."
Jude the Obscure,4,4,"Times are tough, and a lot of their neighbors look strangely at Sue and Jude. Jude decides to take up his own independent stonemason work, and Sue helps him."
Jude the Obscure,4,5,"Just when you thought things might turn bright and happy (which Hardy never lets you believe for long in this book), Arabella shows up out of the blue. That woman has a psychic sense for the worst times she could possibly appear, we swear. She calls on Jude at his house, but only Sue is home."
Jude the Obscure,4,6,"Not one for politeness or human decency, Arabella calls again, and Sue begs Jude not to see her. In fact, to keep him from going to see Arabella, Sue flings herself at Jude. She tells him, 'I am not a cold-natured, sexless creature, for keeping you at such a distance' (5.2.63). Whew. It took them a long time (like, over a year of living together), but Jude and Sue have finally had sex."
Jude the Obscure,4,7,Sue goes to see Arabella and tells her to write to Jude about whatever business she has with him.
Jude the Obscure,4,8,"Putting aside old fears of marriage, Sue and Jude go to the courthouse to get hitched…and then change their minds. (Are you noticing a pattern with these two?)"
Jude the Obscure,4,9,"A letter arrives from Arabella with yet another bombshell. She informs Jude that he has a son from their marriage that she never told him about. Boom! Moreover, the boy has returned from Australia and will be coming to stay with Jude, because her new husband can't know about the child. Boom again! (Seriously, what is wrong with this woman? Does she have no sense of personal responsibility? Jude has the most intensely awful luck …)"
Jude the Obscure,4,10,"Kind soul that she is, Sue decides that they must take care of the child."
Jude the Obscure,4,11,"Enter Little Father Time! Yep, that's the boy's nickname. It's unusual for a major character to show up two-thirds of the way through the novel, but that's how Thomas Hardy rolls. He's a rule-breaker, a rebel, a maverick—or maybe he just likes surprises. On a side note, Little Father Time would make a really cool band name (if you could shake off the negative associations of what this kid is like)."
Jude the Obscure,4,12,LFT walks to Jude and Sue's house.
Jude the Obscure,4,13,"With the arrival of the boy, Sue decides that it is really time to get officially married, now."
Jude the Obscure,4,14,"Okay, people, it's finally going to happen. Jude and Sue are absolutely—no question, no doubt, no hesitations—going to get married and live happily ever after. We all believe them, right? Sue and Jude go to get the marriage certificate issued. This is it!"
Jude the Obscure,4,15,"Mrs Edlin, the widow who took care of their late aunt, arrives to be their witness."
Jude the Obscure,4,16,"They're so close. They just have to close the deal and call it a day. They go to get married. And Sue freaks out. (Again? Seriously, Sue? This marriage-phobia is getting out of control.)"
Jude the Obscure,4,17,"Maybe if they saw someone else get married it might make things better. (Sure, that sounds like something rational human beings would do.) Sue and Jude go to listen to a wedding at a church…and they decide not to marry. (Whaaaat? We're not saying that marriage is the be-all end-all of relationships or anything, but come on, guys—you're obviously making your lives harder than they have to be!)"
Jude the Obscure,4,18,"Unmarried, they go back home. They tell the widow Mrs Edlin, but they agree not to tell Little Father Time. (Yet another in a seemingly endless cascade of great decisions from Jude and Sue …)"
Jude the Obscure,4,19,"Jude, Sue, and LFT have a little family outing to the Great Wessex Agricultural Show."
Jude the Obscure,4,20,(Shows and fairs like this were big back in the day. Check out the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition if you really want to see a Fair that changed the world.)
Jude the Obscure,4,21,"As luck would have it, Arabella and her husband are also there. (Arabella is like the dictionary definition of a bad penny.) Arabella spots Sue and Jude and becomes obsessed with her ex-husband and his current lady friend. She leaves her husband behind and follows them."
Jude the Obscure,4,22,"Arabella's old friend Anny (one of the girls who was with her when she first met Jude) sees Arabella. They talk about Jude, and then continue following the couple."
Jude the Obscure,4,23,"We guess no visit to the fair is complete without a chance to check out your own handy work: Jude and Sue have a model of one of the colleges from Christminster on display. (So that obsession with Christminster is also still going strong, we see.)"
Jude the Obscure,4,24,"Just in case you felt the lack of some of the characters from early in the novel, Dr. Vilbert the quack turns up unexpectedly to sells Arabella a love potion."
Jude the Obscure,4,25,"In the hopes of making LFT happy, Sue and Jude bring him to look at some of the lovely flowers on display. But nothing interests the boy. He apologizes to Sue and Jude (whom he calls Mother and Father): 'I should like the flowers very very much, if I didn't keep on thinking they'd all be withered in a few days!' This kid has a dark worldview, certainly—we'd call him Eeyore-like, except that he's a heck of a lot more disturbing than everybody's favorite gloomy animated donkey."
Jude the Obscure,4,26,"As the gossips talk more and more about Jude and Sue's unconventional (by which we mean still unmarried) situation and children at school make fun of LFT, Jude and Sue leave for London to get married. When they return, Sue takes Jude's last name."
Jude the Obscure,4,27,(Side note: don't let this name thing fool you. They are not really married.)
Jude the Obscure,4,28,The added mystery of their supposed marriage in London just makes people question them more.
Jude the Obscure,4,29,"Victorian England is no place for scandal, so Jude starts to lose work."
Jude the Obscure,4,30,"We discover that Sue is pregnant (though, of course, the word is never used)."
Jude the Obscure,4,31,They are forced auction off their belongings.
Jude the Obscure,4,32,"Sue sells her pet pigeons to be used as food, but Sue can't bear the thought of it. She tracks them down, and sets the pigeons free!"
Jude the Obscure,4,33,The little family decides to move without telling anyone where they are going.
Jude the Obscure,4,34,"Once again, we jump forward in time, and once again, the future is even worse than what we've already seen. It's like Terminatoror Looper(with less time travel and fewer scenes of horrifying violence). Our point is, the future is generally a terrible place in Jude the Obscure. Two and a half years of nomad-style roaming have passed for Jude, Sue, and the fam."
Jude the Obscure,4,35,"Things had been going really well, but then Jude fell ill."
Jude the Obscure,4,36,"To make a little extra money, Sue sells homemade gingerbreads (in the shapes of buildings from Christminster) at fairs and shows."
Jude the Obscure,4,37,Arabella sees her selling her wares.
Jude the Obscure,4,38,We learn that Sue and Jude now have two children of their own along with LFT.
Jude the Obscure,4,39,It turns out that Arabella has become a serious Christian after the death of her husband. She has come to the fair to hear a religious man speak in honor of the new chapel going up.
Jude the Obscure,4,40,"When Arabella spots Sue with her gingerbreads, she tells Sue she wishes she had kept LFT."
Jude the Obscure,4,41,"Once again, cue the ominous music: Arabella wants Jude back. Now we get it: Arabella is like Veruca Salt in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory: she wants everything nooooow.And since Jude continues not to be technically married to Sue, there is no legal reason why they shouldn't be together."
Jude the Obscure,4,42,Chance once again intervenes as Arabella passes a tired and old Phillotson and gives him a ride.
Jude the Obscure,4,43,He has returned to Marygreen and has been reduced to working in a small school for a friend.
Jude the Obscure,4,44,Sue tells Jude about seeing Arabella at the fair. He decides it's time to move on again. One guess at where he wants to go…
Jude the Obscure,1,0,"Flash-forward three more years, and it's finally Christminster time! We've heard the legend, and now we're going to see the real thing."
Jude the Obscure,1,1,"Brace yourselves, everybody, because it's going to be a bumpy ride."
Jude the Obscure,1,2,"First things first, Hardy takes a step back to show us Jude pre-Christminster one last time. At his aunt's house, Jude sees a portrait of his cousin Sue Bridehead. Take note, people, because the girl in that portrait is about to become one of the most fascinating characters in English literature. But now, back to Christminster: Jude finds lodging, and then walks through the city of his dreams in a kind of haze."
Jude the Obscure,1,3,"When he gets back to his new home, he has a nice sleep and then wakes up determined to track down Sue Bridehead. Wow, that must be some portrait."
Jude the Obscure,1,4,"A guy can't live on dreamy walks through the city and beautiful portraits alone (sadly), so Jude looks for work. He also notices that the city looks different by day than it did by night. The magic of it just isn't quite there. (Uh oh. A bad sign of larger disappointments to come?)"
Jude the Obscure,1,5,"Sometimes, imagination just isn't enough. Jude requests Sue's portrait from his aunt, and it arrives. Yay, now he can stare at her all the time. (Ew. Just saying.)"
Jude the Obscure,1,6,"However, his aunt makes it clear that he is not to seek out or bother his cousin. You see, his aunt knows that marriage and relationships don't work in the family (yeah, this cousins thing—already, we can tell that Jude is being unwise) and she's trying to nip their relationship in the bud before it even starts."
Jude the Obscure,1,7,More day job fun! Jude gets work as a stonemason once again.
Jude the Obscure,1,8,"All that stalking finally pays off, and Jude learns of Sue's whereabouts."
Jude the Obscure,1,9,"He tracks Sue down at her work, but he doesn't talk to her. He just kind of looks at her like the weird loner he's turning into. (Ew x 1000.)"
Jude the Obscure,1,10,"Hey, if you can't talk to your gal at work, why not try a House of God? Jude tracks Sue down at church. Still no talking, though, just stalking."
Jude the Obscure,1,11,"While the reader picked up on it pages ago, Jude starts to realize that his interest in Sue goes well beyond that of just wanting to hang out with his cousin. (Yeah, we've got tons of cousins, and we've never stalked any of them through the streets of a fictional town. Go figure!)"
Jude the Obscure,1,12,"Heads up. POV shift! For a moment, Hardy moves his focus to Sue and away from Jude, and we see her buy two large figures of Venus (Roman goddess of love and sex) and Apollo (Greek god of light, music, poetry and a heck of a lot more)."
Jude the Obscure,1,13,"She takes them back to the very Christian place where she works and lives, covering them along the way. She lies to her house mistress (which is like a landlady) and says they are statues of 'St Peter and St—St Mary Magdalen' (2.3.176). This scene gives us a sense of how very strict the people around Sue are about their Christian faith."
Jude the Obscure,1,14,"Sue lies awake late at night. Hardy points out that Jude is also awake at the same time. It's a little ""Somewhere Out There,""if Jude and Sue were adorable singing mice heading towards a happy ending, of course. Which they aren't, unfortunately for them. Still, it's nice."
Jude the Obscure,1,15,"While Jude hones his stonemasonry chops by repairing a church, he sees Sue. Lighting bolt! He comes to realize that man needs more than just work in his life. He needs love."
Jude the Obscure,1,16,"Jude prays to stop his desire for Sue. (Obviously, this doesn't work.)"
Jude the Obscure,1,17,"Apparently, stalking can be a two-way street. Sue arrives at Jude's place of business and looks for him. He's not there."
Jude the Obscure,1,18,She leaves a note for him.
Jude the Obscure,1,19,"Jude decides it's time to finally talk to her, and he responds to set up a meeting."
Jude the Obscure,1,20,"And drumroll, please: Jude and Sue meet at last! This is it, folks. The fateful (or fatal, depending on how you look at it) moment we've all been dreading."
Jude the Obscure,1,21,"At this meeting, Jude learns that Sue will be leaving Christminster soon. He can't let that happen—not when their mutual stalking has finally brought them together."
Jude the Obscure,1,22,Jude learns that his old teacher Phillotson never made it as a scholar and is still a schoolmaster just outside of the city.
Jude the Obscure,1,23,"Jude arrives at Phillotson's school with Sue. Phillotson doesn't really remember Jude at all, but soon they figure things out and start talking."
Jude the Obscure,1,24,"In a bold move to keep Sue in the neighborhood, Jude asks Phillotson to take Sue on as a teacher. Phillotson agrees, and Sue gets a job working at Phillotson's school."
Jude the Obscure,1,25,"As a brilliant, charming individual, Sue makes a great teacher's aid right off the bat."
Jude the Obscure,1,26,Sue and Phillotson take their class to Christminster to see an exhibition of a model of Jerusalem.
Jude the Obscure,1,27,"Working and lurking (as he so likes to do), Jude sees them there. It's pretty clear at this point that both Jude and Phillotson are in love with Sue."
Jude the Obscure,1,28,"And of course, Sue doesn't notice anything of what's going on around her."
Jude the Obscure,1,29,"It's time for a rendezvous. Sue tells Jude to come visit her at the school. Cousins who are secretly in love with each other can just hang out as friends, right?"
Jude the Obscure,1,30,"Feeling like a knight on a grand quest, poor Jude makes his way out there. It all turns sad and ugly when Jude sees Phillotson wrapping his arms around Sue."
Jude the Obscure,1,31,Jude leaves without letting them know he's ever been there. (We imagine it went a little something like this.)
Jude the Obscure,1,32,"Nothing like a sick family member to give a guy a break from his love woes. Jude returns to Marygreen to visit his sick aunt. There, they speak of Sue."
Jude the Obscure,1,33,"Determined to stick to his dream of scholarship, Jude approaches a headmaster of one of the colleges on the streets of Christminster."
Jude the Obscure,1,34,Jude wants to know what he can do to get into the colleges that seem to be only for the rich kids. He ends up sending letters to various colleges to plead his case.
Jude the Obscure,1,35,Jude finds out that Phillotson is moving.
Jude the Obscure,1,36,"A letter from one of the colleges finally arrives. It informs Jude that he ""will have a much better chance of success in life by remaining in [his] own sphere"" (2.6.50). In other words, don't get any ideas, poor kid—you don't belong here. Yep, that's how they roll at the colleges in Christminster: snobs, the lot of them."
Jude the Obscure,1,37,"In a moment of rebellion, Jude goes literary on them, and chalks a bit of scripture on the wall of one of the colleges—Job 12:3 to be exact, which starts, 'I have understanding as well as you' (2.6.59). And that's how you tag, y'all."
Jude the Obscure,1,38,"Deeply depressed after rereading the letter from the headmaster of the college, Jude seeks out the ""real"" Christminster."
Jude the Obscure,1,39,"Apparently, the ""real"" Christminster involves getting drunk and showing off all of the Latin you know to fellow drinkers at the local pub. Not so much our idea of a good time, but hey, Jude clearly needs to blow off some steam."
Jude the Obscure,1,40,"Drunk and a total mess, Jude goes to Sue. He sleeps there, and slinks off in the morning, embarrassed by his actions."
Jude the Obscure,1,41,"In moments like these, only your old aunt can help you, so Jude goes back to Marygreen. He sees himself as a failure."
Jude the Obscure,1,42,"Realizing he will never be a bishop or a scholar as he wanted, Jude sets his sights on joining the church as a licentiate, someone who has a university degree to do a specific profession."
Jude the Obscure,1,43,"A licentiate is quite a bit lower down in the pecking order than a bishop, but much more interesting from a spelling perspective."
Jude the Obscure,0,0,"The schoolmaster, Richard Phillotson departs Marygreen for Christminster to become a great scholar. (By the way, Hardy based the fictional city of Christminster on famous real-life English university town Oxford. So Hardy's portrayal of Christminster reflects some of his views on real-world English university culture.)"
Jude the Obscure,0,1,"Jude, at eleven years old, is bummed out by the departure of his schoolmaster."
Jude the Obscure,0,2,Jude tells Phillotson to leave his piano with Jude's aunt until he can send for it in Christminster.
Jude the Obscure,0,3,"It's a really short chapter, but Jude now knows of Christminster, and that is oh so important to everything that happens next."
Jude the Obscure,0,4,"Oh, but we can't forget Jude's day job."
Jude the Obscure,0,5,Jude's gainfully employed as the official bird-scarer on a neighboring farmer's property.
Jude the Obscure,0,6,"Unfortunately, job security is just about nonexistent in the bird-scaring industry. Jude gets the ax when, instead of shooing the birds away, he lets them eat."
Jude the Obscure,0,7,"Depressed and bordering on a life of emo-style sadness, Jude runs into two guys on the road who tell him where Christminster is located."
Jude the Obscure,0,8,"Jude follows a path that leads out of his little town. Dreaming of Christminster, he reaches a spot where ""all before him was bleak open down"" (1.2.42)."
Jude the Obscure,0,9,"New day job! Jude works for his aunt, now, but in his down time, he's honing his bookworm skills."
Jude the Obscure,0,10,His big dreams just keep getting bigger.
Jude the Obscure,0,11,"Jude imagines Christminster as this heaven on earth for scholars—a place where he will finally be able to learn.(Here, we're imagining Jude as Belle singing at the beginning of Beauty and the Beast: ""I want adventure in the great wide somewhere/I want it more than I can teeeeell."""
Jude the Obscure,0,12,"Jude climbs to a spot where he thinks he might be able to see the city. As the sun sets, Jude sees the lights of Christminster in the distance. 'It is a city of light,' (1.3.42), he tells himself."
Jude the Obscure,0,13,"Ah, the innocence of youth."
Jude the Obscure,0,14,"Dr. Vilbert, a local quack doctor, meets Jude on the road. Vilbert says he'll give Jude the grammar books he desperately wants if Jude gets Vilbert addresses of people who might buy Vilbert's curing products. This is pretty much the Victorian equivalent of the oldNigerian Prince email scam."
Jude the Obscure,0,15,"Jude holds up his end of the bargain, but Vilbert bails, which can only mean one thing: it's time to call in the big guns."
Jude the Obscure,0,16,"Jude writes to Phillotson in Christminster, and asks him for some books."
Jude the Obscure,0,17,"Good guy that he is, Phil. sends Jude some Latin and Greek books, which fly way over a poor, baffled Jude's head. He's left bummed, lonely, and totally disheartened."
Jude the Obscure,0,18,Flash forward three or four years.
Jude the Obscure,0,19,"Jude spends his days reading while carting around baking goods for his aunt. The locals see this driving while reading (is that a DWR?) as a danger to others on the road, even though the horse knows his own way perfectly well without Jude's help."
Jude the Obscure,0,20,"The policeman warns Jude to avoid texting—ahem, reading while up on his cart. So Jude gets really good at hiding his books while he's driving his horse."
Jude the Obscure,0,21,"By the age of 16, Jude has picked up quite a bit of Latin, and his self-studies have definitely made him stand out in his small town."
Jude the Obscure,0,22,Time for some tragic delusions of grandeur! Jude dreams about becoming a high-ranking clergyman (which is another term for a minister or priest) someday. He decides to refocus his studies on the Gospels instead of the Greek and Roman classics.
Jude the Obscure,0,23,Jude also realizes he'll need to make more money to get to Christminster to pursue his dream.
Jude the Obscure,0,24,"Solution? Stonemasonry—the chosen career of budding scholars everywhere (or wait, is that nowhere?). When he's 19, Jude apprentices with the local mason, and launches his career."
Jude the Obscure,0,25,Hardy kicks off this chapter with Jude believing he can make it to Christminster within a year.
Jude the Obscure,0,26,"Jude has shifted his dreams of classical scholarship to becoming a Bishop in the church—you know, basic teenage stuff. Wasn't there a whole Katy Perry song about living the teenage dream of becoming a Bishop?"
Jude the Obscure,0,27,"So, Jude is definitely upping the stakes for this whole becoming-a-scholar thing. But no matter what intellectual pursuit he seeks, Christminster is still the place to make this happen. He commits himself to leading a pure, Christian life. (We sense a but coming Jude's way.)"
Jude the Obscure,0,28,"While on a walk, Jude gets hit in the face with a bit of pig grease thrown by a group of three girls."
Jude the Obscure,0,29,"NBD, right? Wrong. Because one of those girls is the lovely Arabella Donn. Once she enters the scene, Jude's life is changed forever."
Jude the Obscure,0,30,"After walking and talking and flirting for a while, Jude and Arabella (he calls her Abbey at some points) plan on continuing to see each other."
Jude the Obscure,0,31,Pig grease and dimples go a long way with young Jude. He starts feeling things for Arabella that he's never felt for a girl before.
Jude the Obscure,0,32,"Whatever she offers, Jude knows it is ""quite antipathetic to that side of him which had been occupied with literary study and the magnificent Christminster dream"" (1.6.62). In other words: this girl means nuthin' but trouble to Jude and to his desire to make it in Christminster."
Jude the Obscure,0,33,"Ah, classic pre-date jitters: should I call her? Should I play it cool? Should I just ignore her and pretend like we never even met?"
Jude the Obscure,0,34,Jude debates whether or not he should call on Arabella as he promised. He starts to think he may have been a bit hasty. It's not like he's used to this whole love thing—we can cut him a little slack for being fluttery and undecided.
Jude the Obscure,0,35,"Deciding it's the classy thing to do, Jude follows up on his promise and calls on Arabella."
Jude the Obscure,0,36,"They go for a walk together. Apparently, going for a walk is like the Victorian equivalent of dinner and a movie."
Jude the Obscure,0,37,"They see a fire and run to it. (We're guessing there may not be a lot of other entertainment options in Marygreen, Wessex for two kids out on their first date.) It takes way longer to get there than they thought it would."
Jude the Obscure,0,38,"Jude and Arabella find their way to a local drinking spot to get some tea. The tea takes too long, so they settle for beer."
Jude the Obscure,0,39,"On the wall hangs a picture of Samson and Delilah. Samson's that guy in the Bible who has the bad luck to fall head-over-heels with the traitor Delilah, letting her know that all of his God-given strength is thanks to his uncut hair. Delilah cuts Samson's hair and bam no more strength for Samson."
Jude the Obscure,0,40,"As a Biblical scholar, you would think Jude might take this picture as a major Bad Sign about the new lady he's taking out for a drink. But no—we the readers are the ones stuck saying, nooooooo! Don't do it, Jude!"
Jude the Obscure,0,41,"Jude and Arabella walk home, holding hands. They also share their first kiss! Now, they live happily ever after, right? Right?"
Jude the Obscure,0,42,"When they get back home, everyone's pumped because they assume that Jude locked it down and that the lovebirds are engaged. Not so much. But we should cut 'em some slack, because back then, that wouldn't have been a totally off base assumption."
Jude the Obscure,0,43,"Jude heads home, keeping mum about his love life. Arabella, on the other hand, is blabbing about it to everyone she knows."
Jude the Obscure,0,44,"Sure, Jude is a little confused about what he's feeling, but he really wants to see her again. He falls into a typical post-first-date six-day depression until they can go out once more."
Jude the Obscure,0,45,"In the meantime, Arabella is all 'I want to marry Jude' to her friends. Luckily, her friends know just what to do."
Jude the Obscure,0,46,"Her friends tell her that she needs to do a few things to secure Jude's hand in marriage. And while the book isn't too clear on what these things are, we get the sense that they aren't really appropriate for life before marriage in the 1890s. That is all we shall say on the matter."
Jude the Obscure,0,47,"Jude finds Arabella tending to the pigs. Her family is in the pig tending business, which is an invitation to romance right there!"
Jude the Obscure,0,48,"Time for a good old pig run. A few of the pigs break free, and they end up chasing one for a really long time. They don't catch it, but Arabella is pretty sure it will get back to the house at some point."
Jude the Obscure,0,49,"As they walk, they flirt, Jude puts his arm around her, but she refuses to kiss him."
Jude the Obscure,0,50,"She refuses again when they get to her house, and Jude returns home thinking he must have overstepped his bounds with her. Jude is kind of foolish that way: he's really not seeing the writing on the wall when it comes to Arabella's intentions."
Jude the Obscure,0,51,"But Arabella's no fool, and she knows what she wants. So before their next pseudo-date, she arranges to have the house all to herself."
Jude the Obscure,0,52,"You know what that means, Shmoopers…"
Jude the Obscure,0,53,"After they go for another stroll, she invites him in. They play hide and seek (we guess that's the Victorian version of foreplay), and the game eventually finds them together in a room upstairs. Uh oh."
Jude the Obscure,0,54,"Uh oh is right. Next thing you know, Arabella's dropping a bomb in Jude's lap: she's knocked up. Okay, well she doesn't actually say that, because the word ""pregnant"" doesn't get thrown around in Victorian English literature (or 1950s American television for that matter. Check out the I Love Lucy episode ""Lucy is Enceinte"" to see how they used to get around it.)"
Jude the Obscure,0,55,"Before this, Jude was planning to bolt. Arabella was wearing him down, and he wanted to head to Christminster. Not anymore. Jude says that they must get married."
Jude the Obscure,0,56,"As Hardy puts it, marriage is ""the custom of the rural districts among honourable young men who had drifted so far into intimacy with a woman"" (1.9.13). In other words, in this day and age, once a man has had sex with a woman, he has a responsibility to marry her—even though Jude is only sixteen."
Jude the Obscure,0,57,His dreams of being a Bishop are disappearing as we watch.
Jude the Obscure,0,58,Jude and Arabella marry in a small ceremony.
Jude the Obscure,0,59,"The couple spends their first night together, and let's just say the honeymoon is short lived. Jude finds out that Arabella's hair is mostly extensions. This is one less-than-subtle sign that he doesn't actually know his new wife that well."
Jude the Obscure,0,60,"Next bomb drop! Arabella tells Jude that she's not having a baby after all. Not surprisingly, this kind of floors Jude, but now he is stuck in the marriage."
Jude the Obscure,0,61,"The unhappily married couple prepares to kill a pig they've been raising. After all, it's the little things you do together that make marriage fun."
Jude the Obscure,0,62,"Arabella wants to kill the pig slowly, because that is best for cooking and selling, but Jude doesn't want the animal to suffer, so he kills it fast, knocking over a bucket of blood in the process. (Ugh. Clearly, these two are not sympatico …)"
Jude the Obscure,0,63,"Time to get out, Jude! He leaves the house and happens to overhear Arabella's friends talking."
Jude the Obscure,0,64,"One of the girls says, ''Tis my belief she knew there was nothing the matter when she told him there was…"" (1.10.50). In other words, I think Arabella knew she wasn't pregnant when she told Jude she was. Jude starts to suspect that he's been tricked into holy matrimony."
Jude the Obscure,0,65,The young married couple can't stand each other (with good reason!). They have a pretty serious fight.
Jude the Obscure,0,66,"Always the drama queen, Arabella tears at her hair and rips her dress. She stumbles into the street and calls to passersby, 'See how he's served me!' (1.11.10)"
Jude the Obscure,0,67,"That's pretty much the death knell for this marriage, and Jude just can't deal."
Jude the Obscure,0,68,"Depressed as all get out, Jude tries to kill himself in a frozen pond, but the ice won't crack. Jude figures ""he was not a sufficiently dignified person for suicide"" (1.11.23). Needless to say, this is a low point for Jude."
Jude the Obscure,0,69,"Getting dumped by letter may not be the greatest thing in the world, but in this case, we think it's for the best. Arabella leaves a note saying she's gone and won't be coming back."
Jude the Obscure,0,70,"She gets almost as far away as possible, heading to Australia with her family. She sells off all of her and Jude's things in the process."
Jude the Obscure,0,71,"Jude finds a portrait of himself that he gave Arabella in a small shop. He buys the portrait and burns it. It's another pretty emo moment for Jude when all is said and done, but it also makes him feel a lot better—like deleting pictures of old girlfriends from your iPhone."
Jude the Obscure,0,72,"With his wife in another hemisphere and the symbolic rebirth from the burned portrait, Jude's dream of going to Christminster finally returns."
Jude the Obscure,0,73,"That's the end of the book's first part. It's also a good spot to take a little break. Why not listen to ""Hey, Jude"" to keep things appropriately British and Jude-related? The Jude in the song certainly seems a lot happier than our Jude …"
The Miser,10,0,"Cléante comes onstage with his valet, La Flèche, asking the dude why he didn't wait in the house like he was asked. La Flèche answers that Harpagon booted him to the curb."
The Miser,10,1,"Cléante tells La Flèche that he just found out his father is trying to marry his lover, Mariane."
The Miser,10,2,"In the meantime, Cléante has asked La Flèche to find someone who will loan him some money. La Flèche says that it's really tough for borrowers because they're at the mercy of the lenders."
The Miser,10,3,"It turns out that Monsieur Simon, a loan broker, has found someone who will lend Cléante 15,000 francs (French money). However, La Flèche warns Cléante that the loan comes with pretty brutal terms. La Flèche has no clue who is actually putting up the money, since the man wishes to remain secret."
The Miser,10,4,"For starters, the loan comes with an insanely high interest rate of 25%. This is downright exploitation, says Cléante. But what can he do? He needs the money to help Mariane and her mother."
The Miser,10,5,"The next strange condition is that the lender will only give Cléante 12,000 of the 15,000 francs in hard cash. The rest he'll give in a pile of old junk that Cléante should be able to sell for the other 3,000. Cléante, of course, says this is ridiculous."
The Miser,10,6,"Cléante curses his father Harpagon for leaving him so desperate for money. La Flèche adds that he would love to rob the old man blind, if only because Harpagon is such a jerk when it comes to money."
The Miser,11,0,"Cléante and La Flèche talk at the back of the stage, while Harpagon enters with the loan broker Monsieur Simon."
The Miser,11,1,"Simon assures Harpagon that the young man he's loaning money to will be able to pay it back, since he comes from a wealthy family."
The Miser,11,2,La Flèche sees M. Simon talking to Harpagon and seems to figure out what's going on: Harpagon is the mysterious secret man putting up the money.
The Miser,11,3,"M. Simon sees La Flèche and Cléante standing at the far end of the room, and tells Harpagon that Cléante is the young man who needs money."
The Miser,11,4,"Harpagon goes ballistic and yells at Cléante for being so undisciplined with his money, while Cléante accuses Harpagon of being immoral for taking advantage of people's desperation and lending out money at 25% interest."
The Miser,11,5,"M. Simon runs offstage and La Flèche hides. Good call, La Flèche. Good call, M. Simon."
The Miser,8,0,Harpagon returns to the room. Valère stops his loving-boyfriend speech to Élise and starts speaking sternly to her about how she must always obey her father.
The Miser,8,1,"Harpagon is so impressed with Valère that he orders Élise to do everything Valère tells her to. This, she answers, she can definitely do."
The Miser,9,0,"As she leaves, Valère offers Harpagon to follow Élise around to make sure she behaves herself. Harpagon thinks this is a great idea. Élise probably also thinks this is a great idea: tons of time for smooches behind closed doors."
The Miser,24,0,"Harpagon compliments Mariane on how beautiful she is. He notices, though, that Mariane doesn't look very happy to see him. He asks Frosine what the matter is, and Frosine tells him that Mariane is simply awestruck by how stunningly handsome he is."
The Miser,24,1,"Harpagon smiles and introduces Mariane to his daughter, Élise."
The Miser,25,0,"Élise enters the stage and makes the acquaintance of Mariane. Mariane tells Frosine again just how fugly she thinks Harpagon is, but Frosine assures Harpagon that Mariane thinks he's just a perfect specimen of manhood."
The Miser,2,0,"Harpagon, Cléante and Élise's father, comes onstage with a young man named La Flèche, which translates to English as The Arrow. Cool name, or coolest name?"
The Miser,2,1,"Harpagon yells at the young man to get out of his house immediately, because he thinks that La Flèche is spying on him in order to find out where he keeps his money. Whoa there, Harpagon."
The Miser,2,2,"La Flèche doesn't know what the old man is talking about, but Harpagon is beyond paranoid when it comes to his money."
The Miser,2,3,La Flèche assures Harpagon that he couldn't care less whether there is any money hidden around the house.
The Miser,2,4,"When La Flèche finally agrees to leave, however, Harpagon becomes paranoid that the young man already has some stolen cash on him, and commands him to stay where he is. Harpagon then gives La Flèche a full TSA-style pat down, searching every nook and cranny."
The Miser,2,5,"La Flèche curses all old misers and their miserly ways. It takes Harpagon more than a second, though, to realize that he is the miser La Flèche is talking about."
The Miser,2,6,"Harpagon warns La Flèche not to say another word. After one final interrogation, he tells the young man to get out of his house."
The Miser,3,0,"Now that La Flèche is gone, Harpagon is left alone on stage. He gives the audience a nice soliloquy (monologue) about how he doesn't trust La Flèche. Further, he talks about how a person can't be too careful with his money, since having money is the only thing that can make a person happy. Someone whose name rhymes with ""Larpagon"" needs to get his priorities straight."
The Miser,39,0,"Master Jacques enters at the far end of the stage, talking about getting a pig ready for dinner."
The Miser,39,1,"The officer tells him what's going on, and a lightbulb goes on in Jacques head: he sees his opportunity to get revenge on Valère. He tells the officer and Harpagon that he saw Valère take the box of cash."
The Miser,39,2,"The officer, though, wants some kind of proof. Jacques stumbles through a lame testimony, since he can't say what color the cashbox is or how big it is. But Harpagon is more than willing to be convinced."
The Miser,39,3,"Jacques sees Valère coming and begs the officer not to tell Valère about his accusation. For obvious reasons (like, you know, Jacques's testimony was a big fat lie) Jacques wants Valère to be in the dark."
The Miser,38,0,"Harpagon comes onstage with a police officer. The officer brags that he has sent many thieves to be hanged over the years, and that he'll surely catch this one."
The Miser,38,1,"The officer asks if Harpagon has any suspects, and Harpagon says everybody. In many performances, Harpagon turns to the crowd at this point and accuses them."
The Miser,38,2,"The officer advises Harpagon not to go around interrogating everyone, but to gently prod people for evidence in order to build a case. Also, maybe he should take a cold shower or something to stop flipping out so absolutely."
The Miser,33,0,"Now that Frosine, Élise, and Mariane are gone, Harpagon asks Cléante what he thinks of Mariane. Cléante replies that she's just okay: sort of pretty, sort of smart, but nothing special. Basically, he lies. He lies like a rug."
The Miser,33,1,"Harpagon says that really is a shame, because he was about to suggest that Cléante marry Mariane instead of himself."
The Miser,33,2,"Cléante answers that if this is what Harpagon really wants, he'll agree to it. He's a good son like that. But Harpagon says no, no, no—he doesn't want to force Cléante into marrying a woman he doesn't love."
The Miser,33,3,This goes on for a little while before Cléante breaks down and admits that he loves Mariane and has already talked about marriage with her during his many visits to her house.
The Miser,33,4,"Harpagon then turns to the audience and says that this is what he's been trying to figure out all along. Now that he knows Cléante has been working against him, he orders his son to give up trying to marry Mariane. Harpagon has decided to marry her and that's final. Daddy's word is law."
The Miser,33,5,"Cléante, super-angry at being tricked by his devious old Dad, tells Harpagon that there's no way he'll ever give up on marrying Mariane."
The Miser,33,6,"They argue over who should get Mariane, and Harpagon gets so fed up that he calls out for his whoopin' stick."
The Miser,32,0,"As he walks onstage, Harpagon sees Cléante kissing Mariane's hand and gets suspicious."
The Miser,32,1,"When Élise sees Harpagon coming, he tells her that his carriage is now ready to take her and Mariane to the fair."
The Miser,32,2,"Cléante offers to go with the ladies, but Harpagon tells him to hang back."
The Miser,34,0,Jacques comes across Harpagon and Cléante fighting and asks why they're at each other's throats.
The Miser,34,1,"Harpagon, who is seeing red at this point, orders Jacques to decide who is in the right. You know, because Harpagon just knows that Jacques will side with him."
The Miser,34,2,Master Jacques gets the men to stand apart and visits each one separately to learn his side of the story.
The Miser,34,3,"Jacques lies to each of them about what the other is saying. To Cléante, he says that Harpagon is wiling to give him Mariane as long as he shows respect to his father. To Harpagon, he says that Cléante is willing to completely obey him in all things. Clever Jacques."
The Miser,34,4,"Harpagon reaches into his pocket to reward Jacques for his service, but then stops and tells Jacques he'll tip him another time."
The Miser,35,0,There is a short period of happiness between the father and son before they figure out that nothing has been resolved and that Jacques is basically a tricksy hobbit.
The Miser,35,1,"Harpagon tells Cléante that he is disowned and disinherited. Harpagon is going to kick him out into the street. He also curses him, for good measure."
The Miser,43,0,"Cléante comes onstage and tells Harpagon not to worry about his money: he knows where it is. Cléante also tells his father that if he okays the marriage between Cléante and Mariane, he'll get his precious money back. (Harpargon = Gollum, and the moneybox = the One Ring. And by making that comparison, we = total nerds. Nerd pride.)"
The Miser,43,1,"M. Anselme tries to convince Harpagon to consent to the two marriages—Élise to Valère and Cléante to Mariane. Harpagon agrees as long as M. Anselme buys him a new suit… and pays for both weddings. Anselme agrees, both to make the problem go away and because he's a real stand-up guy."
The Miser,43,2,"Everything seems to be wrapped up nicely. The police officer, however, wants to know who's going to pay him for writing up his police notes, since he's been scribbling furiously this entire time."
The Miser,43,3,"Again, M. Anselme opens his wallet to make sure everyone is satisfied. He pays the police officer and everyone leaves the stage. The last line goes to Harpagon, who can only think about seeing his beloved moneybox again. Harpagon rubs his hands together and whispers ""My preciousssss."" (No, we lied. He doesn't do that in the actual play; he only does that in our dreams.)"
The Miser,43,4,"Yup, the villain doesn't change at all by the end of the play, and he isn't even punished. By the end of the play, he's actually richer—he has a snazzy new suit. But hey, those are the breaks sometimes and Molière was too cynical to think that people like Harpagon would just suddenly change."
The Miser,42,0,"For the first time in the play, M. Anselme shows up. Remember him? He's the guy that Harpagon wants to marry his daughter Élise."
The Miser,42,1,Harpagon tells Anselme that he (Anselme) has been robbed of a bride just like Harpagon has been robbed of his money.
The Miser,42,2,"Anselme, who is apparantly a way nicer guy than Harpagon, says he has no interest in forcing someone to marry him. Élise can do what she likes as far as he cares."
The Miser,42,3,"Harpagon again orders the police officer to arrest Valère. But Valère insists again that once everyone knows who he is, they'll stand down."
The Miser,42,4,"Harpagon thinks he's making all of this up, but Valère assures the room that he is a man of noble descent from Naples, Italy."
The Miser,42,5,M. Anselme warns Valère not to lie. He knows everyone in Naples and will know if Valère is telling the truth.
The Miser,42,6,"Valère pops on a fancy looking hat and claims that he is the son of a man named Don Thomas D'Alburci. M. Anselme accuses him of lying, since he claims to know Don Thomas well."
The Miser,42,7,"It's impossible, says M. Anselme, since Don Thomas died sixteen years ago in a shipwreck, along with his wife and children."
The Miser,42,8,Valère says that a servant saved him from the ocean and they were picked up by a Spanish ship sailing nearby. The captain of this ship then raised Valère as his own.
The Miser,42,9,"Valère later heard that his father wasn't in fact dead, and he tried to track him down. But he got sidetracked in his search when he fell in love with Élise."
The Miser,42,10,"M. Anselme isn't convinced, and wants more proof. Valère offers the testimony of the Spanish captain who raised him, as well as a ruby seal that belonged to Don Thomas and an agate bracelet that his mother gave him."
The Miser,42,11,"At this point, Mariane, who has quietly walked onstage, cries out that Valère must be her brother! It turns out that she and her mother also made it out of the shipwreck. They returned to Italy with no estate and have been living a life of poverty ever since."
The Miser,42,12,"When Mariane is finished, M. Anselme also cries out for joy and calls Valère and Mariane his children. It turns out that he is none other than Don Thomas D'Alburci. And yes, he survived the shipwreck, too. He changed his name and started a new life in order to get over the loss of his family."
The Miser,42,13,"When Harpagon finds out that Valère is M. Anselme's son, he demands that M. Anselme pay him the money that Valère has stolen."
The Miser,42,14,"Valère demands to know who said he took the money. When he finds out, he looks like he's going to give Master Jacques another good beat-down."
The Miser,29,0,"While Harpagon is running from the room, a servant comes in and knocks into him, saying that two of Harpagon's horses have lost their shoes and can't walk. Harpagon orders to have the horses taken to the blacksmith to be re-shod."
The Miser,29,1,"Cléante, meanwhile, says he'll take over the duties of the house and show Mariane a good time in the garden. Uh, right. A ""good time"" in the garden."
The Miser,28,0,"Cléante takes off, leaving his father fuming about the loss of his diamond ring."
The Miser,28,1,A servant come onstage and tells Harpagon that there's a gentleman waiting at the door to speak with him.
The Miser,28,2,"Harpagon says he's busy, but when he hears that the man has some money to give him, he bolts out of the room, double-quick."
The Miser,17,0,"Next, Harpagon sends off two other people to clean the glasses. They argue that their servants' clothes are stained and ruined. But Harpagon orders them to stand a certain way so that no one can see the stains and tears. They go off."
The Miser,16,0,"Harpagon enters the stage with his children and a bunch of servants. He orders the servants to get the house ready for supper in the cheapest possible way. The first person he dismisses is Dame Claude, whom he tells to brush the furniture without wearing it out too much. You have to wonder how much furniture damage you can do with a broom."
The Miser,23,0,"With Master Jacques gone, Mariane tells Frosine how she doesn't want to marry Harpagon. Not only is Master Jacques a moldy oldie, but also Mariane is in love with a young man and wants to marry him. Hmm, could the young man in question be Cléante?"
The Miser,23,1,"Frosine guarantees Mariane that she won't be married to Harpagon a year before he kicks the bucket. And once he's dead, Mariane will inherit all his money."
The Miser,23,2,"As Harpagon comes onstage, Mariane cries out at how terrible his face is. Yowch. That's rude."
The Miser,22,0,"Mariane and Frosine come onto the stage. Frosine asks Jacques if Harpagon is home, and Master Jacques says he is and runs off to go tell him the women have arrived."
The Miser,5,0,"Harpagon is left alone with his daughter, Élise. He informs her that he has also found a match for her—a rich, older man named Anselme who will no doubt bring a lot of money into Harpagon's family."
The Miser,5,1,"Élise tries to respectfully reject the idea. But Harpagon commands her to do as he says. Unfortunately, Élise depends on him completely for money, so she can't say no."
The Miser,5,2,"Harpagon sees his servant Valère approaching and tells Élise that they'll put the matter to him and see what he thinks of it. Élise agrees immediately, since Valère is her secret lover. She agrees to do whatever Valère thinks is right."
The Miser,4,0,"While Harpagon is giving his speech, his son Cléante and daughter Élise start talking at the back of the stage. Harpagon continues his speech and talks about how he has buried a box containing 10,000 crowns in gold in his garden."
The Miser,4,1,"While he is talking about his buried gold, Harpagon sees Cléante and Élise at the back of the stage and becomes worried that they've heard him talking about his buried gold. He demands to know what they want and whether they've just heard what he was saying."
The Miser,4,2,"Cléante assures him they heard nothing, but Harpagon doesn't believe him. The old man then tries to lie, saying that he was merely thinking out loud about how tough it is to hold onto money."
The Miser,4,3,"Cléante tells the old man that he has plenty of money, but Harpagon takes exception to this and orders his son never to let anyone around town know that he has money. He then criticizes Cléante for being so extravagant with his money and spending too much. In fact, Harpagon is convinced that the only way Cléante can walk around in such nice clothes is if he's been stealing from his Daddy."
The Miser,4,4,"Cléante says that the only money he has, he spends on clothes. Oh, and whatever money he has he gets from gambling. (Maybe in 17th Century France the house didn't always win?)"
The Miser,4,5,"Élise tells Harpagon that she and Cléante have something that they want to talk to him about. But Harpagon says he also has something to say, and that he'll go first because he's the man in charge. It turns out he wants to talk about marriage."
The Miser,4,6,"Harpagon turns first to Cléante and asks him if he knows a young woman in the neighborhood named Mariane. Cléante says he does, and that he finds her charming and intelligent."
The Miser,4,7,"Harpagon also wants to know if Cléante thinks this woman would make a good wife, and again, Cléante heartily agrees."
The Miser,4,8,"But then Harpagon says great, because he intends on marrying Mariane. It turns out he's already made arrangements with the girl's mother, who consents to the match because Harpagon has money and the mother and daughter are desperate for money."
The Miser,4,9,"Cléante says he isn't feeling well, and leaves the room (probably to go throw up)."
The Miser,30,0,Everyone leaves except Harpagon and Valère. Valère promises to get the horses fixed up as cheaply as possible.
The Miser,31,0,"Cléante, Élise, Frosine, and Mariane retreat to a private space."
The Miser,31,1,Élise tells Mariane that Cléante has told her all about his love for her.
The Miser,31,2,"Mariane says that the situation looks hopeless, since she is dependent on her mother's needs and on Harpagon's money."
The Miser,31,3,"Cléante argues that Mariane should follow her heart instead of always thinking about her daughterly duty. He asks Frosine to back him up, but Frosine is having trouble thinking of a better plan than for Mariane to marry Harpagon."
The Miser,31,4,"Frosine eventually figures that she'll have little trouble getting Mariane's mother to agree to a match with Cléante. But it will be next to impossible to break things off with Harpagon. If Harpagon gets angry about being dumped by Mariane, he'll never consent to her marriage with Cléante. For that reason, they have to find a way to make Harpagon reject Mariane."
The Miser,31,5,"Frosine then gets an idea: they'll get one of her friends to dress up as a rich, beautiful, aristocratic woman who wants to marry Harpagon and give all her riches to him. There's no way in the world that this guy would turn down money and a wife."
The Miser,31,6,Mariane leaves Cléante with the promise that she'll do everything in her power to convince her mother to approve of her marriage to Cléante.
The Miser,27,0,Harpagon apologizes to Mariane for forgetting to ask the servants to bring her refreshments before she goes off to the fair with Élise. Of course he hasn't forgotten—he just doesn't want to offer anything that costs money.
The Miser,27,1,"Cléante, however, tells his father that he has already ordered some wonderful oranges and expensive preserves to give to Mariane. Harpagon loses his mind and curses Cléante to Valère."
The Miser,27,2,"Next, Cléante offers Mariane the valuable diamond ring on his father's finger. She refuses, but he presses it on her, further infuriating his dad."
The Miser,26,0,"Harpagon wants Mariane to meet his son, Cléante. When Cléante enters the stage, Mariane tells Frosine that he is the same young man she wants to marry. Frosine is dumbfounded."
The Miser,26,1,"Cléante, thinking on his feet, tells Mariane that she is the most beautiful woman in the world. But he also says that he isn't happy about the idea of her becoming his stepmother."
The Miser,26,2,"Harpagon thinks that Cléante just doesn't like the idea of having a stepmom, and scolds the boy for his insolence."
The Miser,26,3,"Cléante keeps finding clever ways to compliment Mariane without revealing that he loves her. Eventually, though, he starts laying it on so thick that Harpagon is all like, ""Okay, son. That's enough now."""
The Miser,1,0,Élise's brother Cléante comes onstage as Valère leaves. He tells Élise that he has a secret he's been dying to tell her. He's in love; he's one smitten kitten. But he admits that he's totally dependent on their father for money and will have to convince him to consent to his marriage.
The Miser,1,1,"Élise asks him if he has already become engaged to the woman he loves. He says no, but that he plans to pop the question soon."
The Miser,1,2,"Cléante keeps telling Élise not to talk smack about his plan, because she has never loved before and can't understand what kind of deep feelings he's feeling. Or can she…?"
The Miser,1,3,The girl Cléante loves is named Mariane. She has recently moved into the neighborhood. She's kind and beautiful and intelligent. A total triple threat.
The Miser,1,4,"Cléante has also found out that Mariane and her mother aren't very well off financially. They can barely cover their living expenses. If only Cléante and Élise's father weren't so cheap, Cléante would give Mariane and her mother all the moneys. This leads Cléante to go on a mini rant about how stingy their father is."
The Miser,1,5,"As the scene closes, Cléante vows to do whatever he can to get money for Mariane and her mommy. Élise also mentions how unfortunate it is that Cléante and Élise's mother is dead."
The Miser,1,6,"They hear their father coming down the hallway. They leave the stage, promising one another to make every effort to get their father to pry open his wallet."
The Miser,0,0,"Valère and Élise are alone together, talking about their love and their plans to marry. Élise expresses her doubts about Valère's ability to be faithful to her. But when he assures her of his loyalty, she worries about her father, who will never consent to their marriage because Valère is a mere servant."
The Miser,0,1,We learn that some time ago Valère saved Élise from drowning. She owes her life to him.
The Miser,0,2,"Valère mentions that he is on a quest to find his parents (this should come with a neon flashing Important Plot Point sign). When he finds them, hopefully they'll be able to do something that will improve his chances of winning over Élise's father."
The Miser,0,3,"Valère vows to go out in search of his parents, but Élise begs him not to leave her house. Instead, she recommends that he try as hard as he can to make her father like him."
The Miser,0,4,"Élise suggests that Valère make efforts to get her brother to like him, too. But Valère says that her brother and father are so different that he can only please one of them at a time. So he goes with the father."
The Miser,19,0,"Harpagon turns to his son Cléante and commands him to receive Mariane kindly, since Harpagon knows that sons don't usually like to have stepmothers, especially when stepmom and stepson are the same age."
The Miser,19,1,"Cléante agrees that he isn't happy to be getting Mariane as a stepmother. And he isn't, but not for the reasons Harpagon suspects. Cléante promises to treat Mariane well. You know, because he hearts her."
The Miser,18,0,"Harpagon turns to Élise and tells her to clear the table and prepare to welcome Mariane, Harpagon's bride-to-be. Élise agrees and leaves."
The Miser,13,0,"Alone again (naturally), Harpagon sees a woman named Frosine enter the stage. He tells her that he'll speak to her in a minute, and then tells the audience that he needs to go check on his money."
The Miser,12,0,Cléante and Harpagon continue to accuse one another of immoral behavior. Harpagon vows to keep a closer eye on everything his children do. Cléante leaves.
The Miser,20,0,"Harpagon turns to a man named Master Jacques and tells him that he wants him to do something. Master Jacques asks Harpagon if he is speaking to Jacques the carriage driver or Jacques the cook, since Harpagon is so cheap he gets this one guy to do both jobs."
The Miser,20,1,"Harpagon says he wants to speak to Jacques the cook, so Master Jacques whips off his coat to reveal a cook's uniform."
The Miser,20,2,"Harpagon says he wants a fine meal prepared, and Jacques says this won't be a problem as long as Harpagon is willing to put up some money."
The Miser,20,3,"Taking Harpagon's side, Valère criticizes Jacques's answer and argues that it's perfectly possible to provide an excellent meal with little money."
The Miser,20,4,"One by one, Jacques lists the things they'll need to make a fine supper. Harpagon cringes at every item, counting in his head how much it will cost."
The Miser,20,5,"Valère continues to argue Harpagon's case, scolding Jacques for being so wasteful."
The Miser,20,6,"Next, Harpagon says he wants to speak with Jacques the carriage driver. So Jacques puts on his riding coat and says he's ready to talk."
The Miser,20,7,"Harpagon wants his horses ready to take his daughter and fiancée Mariane to the fair. Master Jacques tells him that his horses are so starved that they can't even walk, let alone pull a carriage. OK, we disliked Harpagon before, but now we freaking hate the man."
The Miser,20,8,Master Jacques says he pities the creatures so much that there's no way he'll drive them.
The Miser,20,9,"Valère says he'll find a neighbor to drive the carriage. Master Jacques is getting sick and tired of Valère's brown-nosing, and they start bickering."
The Miser,20,10,"Master Jacques lets slip that everyone in the town talks negatively about Harpagon. Harpagon demands to know what they say, but Jacques says he won't repeat it for fear of getting himself beaten."
The Miser,20,11,"After much prodding, Master Jacques admits that Harpagon's stinginess makes him the laughingstock of the entire town. It's the only thing people talk about when he comes up in conversation."
The Miser,20,12,Harpagon blows his top and starts beating Jacques for repeating such terrible things. Jacques cries out at the injustice of being beaten for telling the truth.
The Miser,21,0,"After Harpagon leaves, Valère laughs at Master Jacques for getting hit by an old man."
The Miser,21,1,"Jacques accuses Valère of being a spineless jerk, and then decides to play tough with him. He starts pushing Valère and telling him not to mess with him anymore. He also starts hurling insults at Valère."
The Miser,21,2,"Eventually, Valère gets fed up with all this posing and starts pushing Master Jacques back, telling him he's not so tough."
The Miser,21,3,"Master Jacques backs down right away and says he was just joking. Valère says that Master Jacques's jokes are terrible, and gives him a second beating."
The Miser,21,4,"After Valère leaves, Jacques swears revenge."
The Miser,6,0,"When he hears about Harpagon's plans for Élise, Valère stalls at first, saying that it's important for a woman to love her future husband. But Harpagon keeps responding to all of this by saying that Mr. Anselme isn't asking for a dowry, which will save Harpagon tons of money. While Valère tries to talk Harpagon out of his decision to marry off Élise, Harpagon thinks he hears a dog barking in the garden. He becomes worried that someone is after his buried treasure, and he slips out of the room to check."
The Miser,7,0,"Now that Élise and Valère are alone, she checks with him to make sure that he's not actually supporting her father's decision. He says that he needs to look as if he's supporting the old man in order to keep his favor. He also advises Élise to pretend to obey her father for the time being."
The Miser,7,1,"When the time comes to get married, Élise can pretend to be super ill and the family will call in the doctor to postpone the marriage."
The Miser,14,0,La Flèche comes out of his hiding place and meets Frosine on the stage. She tells him that she has come to make a match between Harpagon and the young lady named Mariane.
The Miser,14,1,"Frosine, you see, likes to meddle in other people's business. She kind of does it for a living: she hopes Harpagon will reward her for fixing him up with Mariane."
The Miser,14,2,Good luck getting anything out of that guy! says La Flèche in so many words.
The Miser,14,3,"Frosine has a lot of confidence in her ability to manipulate people, so she doesn't bother herself with what La Flèche has said."
The Miser,14,4,La Flèche leaves as Harpagon returns.
The Miser,15,0,"When Harpagon comes back onstage, Frosine tells him that he looks absolutely incredible. In fact, she says that there are twenty-five year olds who look older than Harpagon, who is just over sixty."
The Miser,15,1,"Frosine then looks at the ""lifeline"" on his palm and tells Harpagon that he's going to live a very long time. She's really laying it on thick."
The Miser,15,2,Harpagon wants to know what answer Mariane gave to his proposal of marriage. Frosine assures him that Mariane received the proposal with joy and that she can't wait to marry him.
The Miser,15,3,"In fact, Mariane will come over in the evening to help celebrate the marriage Harpagon has planned for his daughter Élise to M. Anselme. It is also arranged that, in the afternoon, Élise and Mariane will get acquainted by going to the fair together."
The Miser,15,4,"Next, Harpagon wants to make sure that Mariane not only marries him, but that her mother pays the largest dowry she can afford. That's right, folks. Harpagon wants to get paid for marrying a beautiful woman who's nearly forty years younger than him."
The Miser,15,5,"Frosine says that Harpagon will save 12,000 francs a year just because Mariane will be very cheap to take care of. Harpagon doesn't count this as an actual payment. He wants money in his hands."
The Miser,15,6,"Frosine also tells Harpagon that Mariane prefers older men and thinks that he's a silver fox. Flattery, flattery, flattery."
The Miser,15,7,"Eventually Frosine brings up that fact that she is in danger of losing a lawsuit that she can definitely win if she gets a little money on her side. Harpagon doesn't want to hear about this, though."
The Miser,15,8,"Frosine tries to sandwich her begging in between more compliments, but Harpagon isn't biting. He won't give her a cent. He says he hears someone calling him and leaves the room."
The Miser,15,9,"Left alone on stage, Frosine wishes that Harpagon would go to hell. She still plans on getting her ""reward"" somehow."
The Miser,37,0,"Harpagon goes running around the house screaming that his money has been stolen. He gives us a ridiculously melodramatic speech about how losing his money will surely kill him. Simmer down there, H."
The Miser,37,1,"He plans on accusing everyone in town of robbing him. He'll torture each person until he gets it back. According to the wise Mr. H, he'll then hang everyone, and if he still doesn't get his money back he'll hang himself. Jeepers."
The Miser,40,0,"Seeing Valère, Harpagon accuses him of stealing the cashbox. Valère has no clue what he's talking about—and says so—but Harpagon is certain that he's just playing dumb."
The Miser,40,1,"Eventually, Valère admits that he has committed a theft. Jacques can't believe his luck in actually correctly naming Valère as the robber."
The Miser,40,2,Valère goes on to say that he's been waiting for the right moment to talk to Harpagon about his theft. He also promises that he committed his theft for honorable reasons.
The Miser,40,3,"The more he speaks, the crazier Harpagon thinks he is, since he's talking about the cashbox as if it's a beautiful woman."
The Miser,40,4,"Valère asks for Harpagon's blessing, which Harpagon isn't willing to give."
The Miser,40,5,"Finally, it comes out that this whole time Valère has been talking about getting engaged to Élise under Harpagon's nose."
The Miser,40,6,Harpagon orders the police officer to arrest Valère for stealing the moneybox and his daughter.
The Miser,40,7,"Valère, though, tells Harpagon that he wouldn't treat him this way if he knew who he (Valère) really was."
The Miser,41,0,Élise shows up on stage and Harpagon accuses her of betraying him. But he also tells her that he plans on imprisoning her in his house and sending Valère to be hanged. This guy is really keen on the whole hanging thing.
The Miser,41,1,"Élise tells her father that she would be dead if it weren't for Valère, since he saved her from drowning years before."
The Miser,41,2,"Harpagon tells Élise that he'd rather she have drowned than to have her betray him like this. Yeah, that's pretty harsh."
Tartuffe,10,0,"Tartuffe enters, talking loudly to his servant Laurent, who is off-stage; he's going to go to the prison, he says, to give money to the prisoners."
Tartuffe,10,1,Dorine can't stand his pretentiousness.
Tartuffe,10,2,"Tartuffe can't stand the sight of Dorine's breasts, and he gives her a handkerchief to cover her bosom; he says the sight of it creates unclean thoughts – no doubt in his dirty mind."
Tartuffe,10,3,Dorine calls him out and says that she would feel nothing if he were prancing around naked.
Tartuffe,10,4,"Tartuffe doesn't want to listen to her jibes – and he doesn't have to; Dorine is on her way out. Elmire, she tells him, is headed downstairs to have a chat with him."
Tartuffe,10,5,"When Tartuffe gets too excited about this, Dorine thinks her suspicions have been confirmed. She leaves."
Tartuffe,11,0,Elmire enters.
Tartuffe,11,1,Tartuffe immediately showers her with blessings. She asks him to sit down.
Tartuffe,11,2,"Tartuffe asks about her health, and tells her that he prayed and prayed for her…but that he didn't think his prayers were enough."
Tartuffe,11,3,"Elmire thanks him for his concern and tells him not to worry. Still, Tartuffe does not stop. She tells him that there's an important matter she'd like to discuss. She's glad there's no one around to annoy them."
Tartuffe,11,4,Tartuffe is very glad to hear her say this… It seems he's prayed and prayed for the chance to be alone with her.
Tartuffe,11,5,Elmire asks him to be open with his answers.
Tartuffe,11,6,"He agrees, but before he goes any further he reassures you that all his visits were prompted only by religious feeling and respect."
Tartuffe,11,7,"At this point, he starts trying to put the moves on her…but he's not very smooth."
Tartuffe,11,8,"He takes her hand, but manages to pinch her."
Tartuffe,11,9,When he puts his hand on her knee – and is caught – he tells Elmire that he was only feeling the fine fabric.
Tartuffe,11,10,"Elmire starts moving away from him, but he continues. He feels the lace on her collar and compliments its quality."
Tartuffe,11,11,Elmire ignores him and gets down to business. She asks him if the whole Tartuffe-Mariane wedding thing is true.
Tartuffe,11,12,"Tartuffe tells her that he's heard something about that, but that he'd rather be united with someone else."
Tartuffe,11,13,Elmire takes this to mean that he has no interest in worldly things.
Tartuffe,11,14,"Tartuffe tries to tell her that a man of God can appreciate worldly beauty, and that it's especially easy to see the magnificence of God's creation in her. He confesses his love to Elmire, and tells her that his fate is in her hands."
Tartuffe,11,15,Elmire tells Tartuffe he should have thought a little longer before opening his trap.
Tartuffe,11,16,"Tartuffe uses the whole ""I'm just a man, I'm not an angel!"" defense, and tells her that he simply couldn't refuse her charms. He promises her that everything will be one hundred percent secret, on the down-low."
Tartuffe,11,17,"Elmire asks Tartuffe if, you know, he might be a little afraid of her telling on him."
Tartuffe,11,18,"Tartuffe knows, he says, that she'd never do such a thing."
Tartuffe,11,19,"Elmire agrees to tell no one about what happened, as long as he convinces Orgon to let Mariane marry Valère."
Tartuffe,8,0,"Valère comes in, looking concerned. He's heard that Mariane is supposed to marry Tartuffe now, and he wants some answers."
Tartuffe,8,1,Mariane gets him up to speed.
Tartuffe,8,2,"When Valère asks Mariane what she's going to do, she's reluctant to tell him."
Tartuffe,8,3,"Eventually, she says, she doesn't know what she's going to do."
Tartuffe,8,4,"Valère, clearly annoyed, tells her to go ahead and marry Tartuffe."
Tartuffe,8,5,Mariane tells him that of course she'll follow his advice. The two continue fighting – for no reason in particular – while Dorine watches.
Tartuffe,8,6,"Valère says he knows that Mariane never really loved him, and that, like, whatever, he doesn't need her. He can get some loving just like that, Mariane'll see soon enough. Turns out there's some kind of ""mystery woman"" waiting in the wings for him."
Tartuffe,8,7,"Of course, when Mariane calls his bluff and tells him to get lost, Valère pretends not to hear her."
Tartuffe,8,8,"At this point, Dorine has had enough, and she tells the both of them to get their acts together. She gets them to put aside their silly, totally made-up problems, at least long enough to discuss the whole Orgon-Tartuffe problem."
Tartuffe,8,9,"Dorine tells Mariane to pretend to play along with her father's plan, but to find anyway possible to delay the proceedings-- faking sick, seeing bad omens etc."
Tartuffe,8,10,"Valère, on the other hand, has to go tell his friends what's up and try to get them to pressure Orgon. Oh, and they'll get Damis and Elmire on their side too."
Tartuffe,8,11,"With everything settled, Mariane and Valère finally kiss and make up."
Tartuffe,8,12,Dorine has to forcibly separate them before things get out of control.
Tartuffe,9,0,Damis is ready to kick the crap out of Tartuffe.
Tartuffe,9,1,"The servant tries to calm him down and redirect his energy into some more productive enterprise like, maybe, talking to Elmire. Elmire, it seems, has some ""power"" over Tartuffe – power, no doubt, of the feminine persuasion – and thus might be the key to catching the scoundrel."
Tartuffe,9,2,Dorine has also gotten word that Tartuffe is on his way downstairs.
Tartuffe,9,3,She tells Damis that she's going to intercept him.
Tartuffe,9,4,Damis insists on listening in on the conversation and manages to hide in a close just before…
Tartuffe,24,0,"At this point, Orgon is running around like a chicken with its head cut off."
Tartuffe,24,1,Cléante tries to calm him down. He asks him what's the matter.
Tartuffe,24,2,"As it turns out, Orgon's fears were confirmed. Tartuffe has made off with the contents of the ""strongbox,"" also known as a safe. It seems that, long ago, Orgon's friend Argas brought him the box just before he, that is, Argas, fled the country. As far as Orgon knows, the papers contained within would ruin Argas's reputation if they were ever released. They're what you might call prime blackmail material…sort of like those nude photos of celebrities you hear about every once in a while. We don't know exactly what they are, but they were bad enough to send Argas fleeing from the government...and that's pretty bad."
Tartuffe,24,3,Cléante doesn't understand why Tartuffe would even know about such things.
Tartuffe,24,4,"Orgon, it seems, saw fit to let Tartuffe hold onto the box; he felt guilty about keeping such a secret."
Tartuffe,24,5,"Cléante, usually quick with advice, has nothing to say. Orgon has really messed things up this time."
Tartuffe,24,6,"Orgon curses Tartuffe and swears that he'll never associate with ""pious men"" and that he'll ""persecute them worse than Satan could"" (5.1.10)."
Tartuffe,24,7,"Cléante tells Orgon to stop talking such drivel and wise up. One bad apple doesn't spoil the barrel, as far as Cléante is concerned, and if Orgon wants to prevent another debacle he has to stop taking things to the extreme. Cléante reminds him – and the audience – that there are truly righteous men out there and that, as long as he/they is/are cautious, he/they will be able to avoid frauds like Tartuffe."
Tartuffe,25,0,"Damis enters; he's heard the bad news about Tartuffe, and he's ready to help…by killing him."
Tartuffe,25,1,Cléante tells him to cool his jets.
Tartuffe,2,0,"Elmire, Mariane, and Damis come back, looking worn out. They've been getting another lecture from Madame Pernelle."
Tartuffe,2,1,"Elmire has seen Orgon coming, and she decides to head upstairs."
Tartuffe,2,2,"Cléante agrees to have a chat with him, and promises to bring up the question of Mariane's upcoming marriage to Valère – he wants to make sure he can marry Valère's sister once all is said and done."
Tartuffe,3,0,"Orgon rolls in, having just come from a trip out of town."
Tartuffe,3,1,He proceeds to ignore Cléante.
Tartuffe,3,2,He wants to hear about what's happened to the family in the time since he left.
Tartuffe,3,3,"Dorine tells him that Elmire has been sick with a fever, but all Orgon really wants to hear about is Tartuffe. Every time Dorine tells him anything about his wife – all about how she's felt sick and suffered – he says, ""And Tartuffe?"""
Tartuffe,3,4,"Dorine tells him that he's been doing fine, eating, drinking and sleeping altogether too much for such a pious guy."
Tartuffe,3,5,"That doesn't stop Orgon from exclaiming ""Poor fellow!"" again and again. This goes on for a while. It's what a comedian might call a ""routine"" or a ""bit."""
Tartuffe,3,6,"When Dorine has had enough, she goes off to tell Elmire how ""sympathetic"" Orgon has been."
Tartuffe,29,0,"Just then, Valère shows up – and he's got even more bad news."
Tartuffe,29,1,He's just had word that Tartuffe has denounced Orgon to the King and used the contents of the strongbox to back up his claims. He tells Orgon that he must flee the country immediately.
Tartuffe,29,2,Cléante states the obvious: Tartuffe's done this to make sure he can seize Orgon's estate without trouble.
Tartuffe,29,3,"Valère urges Orgon to leave; he's got a carriage waiting outside, and enough cash to get him out. He promises to travel with him until they find a safe place to stay.Orgon says his goodbyes and is half out the door when…"
Tartuffe,28,0,"Orgon turns to his mother and says, ""I told you so."""
Tartuffe,28,1,Of course now she's shocked by what she's seen.
Tartuffe,28,2,"Dorine tells them all not to be so ungrateful (sarcasm alert!); after all, Tartuffe's just trying to rid them of all the earthly things that are separating them from heaven."
Tartuffe,28,3,Orgon tells her to shut up.
Tartuffe,28,4,Cléante reminds everyone that they still don't have a plan.
Tartuffe,28,5,"Elmire proposes that they let everybody know what a liar and cheat Tartuffe is, in the hope that the resulting backlash – let's call it really, really bad publicity – will prevent Tartuffe from carrying out his plan."
Tartuffe,17,0,"Dorine, Mariane, and Elmire roll in looking concerned."
Tartuffe,17,1,"It seems Mariane isn't taking the whole ""marrying Tartuffe that evening"" thing too well."
Tartuffe,17,2,She wants to do whatever she can to stop it from happening.
Tartuffe,16,0,We find Cléante and Tartuffe having a conversation concerning the recent ruckus between Damis and Orgon.
Tartuffe,16,1,"Cléante tells Tartuffe that the town's abuzz with rumors about the conflict, then lays down a hypothetical: Assuming that Damis's to blame, shouldn't Tartuffe, being a good Christian and all, forgive him and let him reclaim his inheritance?"
Tartuffe,16,2,"Tartuffe tells Cléante that he would love to patch things up with Damis, but at this point it really isn't possible; it's just not in the divine cards. If he were to start acting nice now, he says, things would just look suspicious, like he were just trying to stop Damis from defaming him."
Tartuffe,16,3,"Cléante doesn't buy Tartuffe's reasoning and he tells him so. You should do the right thing, he says, no matter what other people will think."
Tartuffe,16,4,"Tartuffe tells him that he has already forgiven Damis, but even so he doesn't have to live with the jerk who defamed him."
Tartuffe,16,5,"But, Cléante asks, surely you didn't have to accept Damis's inheritance."
Tartuffe,16,6,"Tartuffe insists he doesn't really care for earthly things; he just wants to, you know, make sure bad guys don't get their hands on it. Just like he watches over Elmire to make sure bad guys don't get their hands on her."
Tartuffe,16,7,"Cléante counters; as far as he can see, Damis should at least be given the chance to use the wealth. He sums up his old arguments again but – surprise, surprise – Tartuffe doesn't listen."
Tartuffe,16,8,Tartuffe takes his leave.
Tartuffe,16,9,"All Cléante can say is ""damn"" (4.1.9). Damn, indeed."
Tartuffe,23,0,Elmire is confused by this last remark; she asks Orgon what Tartuffe meant.
Tartuffe,23,1,"Orgon, dolt that he is, has signed a ""deed of gift,"" a document that transfers ownership of something to another party. In this case, that something, seems to be, well, everything. To top it all off, he fears that Tartuffe may have made off with something else very, very valuable that Orgon kept locked away."
Tartuffe,22,0,"Tartuffe comes in, ready to go. Everything is clear. He does not see Orgon."
Tartuffe,22,1,"Orgon comes out, guns blazing. Well, not literally. He starts chewing Tartuffe out, and claims to have ""long suspected"" him (4.7.2). It seems Tartuffe doesn't have a monopoly on lying."
Tartuffe,22,2,"When Orgon tells Tartuffe to hit the road, Tartuffe turns the tables. Before running he declares, ""This house belongs to me, I'll have you know."""
Tartuffe,5,0,"Orgon decides it's time he had a little heart-to-heart with Mariane, but before the confab can begin, he checks the room for eavesdroppers."
Tartuffe,5,1,"That done, he starts buttering her up, telling her how good a daughter she is. He goes on to say that in order to repay him for his love she should do what she's told. She, being the good daughter that she is, responds in the affirmative."
Tartuffe,5,2,"Orgon pops the question, or, uh, a question: How do you like Tartuffe? It's the kind of thing you might have had your best bud do for you in Middle School – he's like Tartuffe's wingman."
Tartuffe,5,3,"Mariane doesn't really know what to say and, so, she tells Orgon that whatever's good for Daddy's good for her."
Tartuffe,5,4,"Unfortunately, Orgon wants her to marry Tartuffe."
Tartuffe,5,5,"Mariane is horrified, and when Orgon tries to get her to say that she loves the hypocrite, she tells him it'd simply be a big fat lie."
Tartuffe,5,6,Just when things are about to get nasty…
Tartuffe,4,0,Now it's time for the title bout between Cléante and Orgon.
Tartuffe,4,1,Cléante tells his brother-in-law that Dorine was disrespecting him – and with good reason. He asks him how he could fall for Tartuffe's tricks.
Tartuffe,4,2,"Orgon will hear none of this. He tells Cléante about how cool, how brilliant and humble Tartuffe is. Soon enough, Orgon promises, Cléante, will see the light. Oh, and Orgon also says that, thanks to Tartuffe and his most excellent teachings, he could lose his whole family, mother, children, brother and wife, and not feel a thing. Yuck."
Tartuffe,4,3,"Cléante listens to Orgon babble on for a while, listens to him talk about his first encounter with Tartuffe. It seems that Orgon found him praying, weeping loudly, kissing the ground, and all sorts of overly showy stuff. This didn't stop Orgon from developing a huge man-crush on Tartuffe and, well, before you know it, he was living in Orgon's house."
Tartuffe,4,4,"He goes on to tell Cléante how Tartuffe helps to ""keep an eye"" on Elmire, and that he's a veritable sin detector. Heck, he won't even hurt a fly."
Tartuffe,4,5,"Cléante, ever reasonable, can't believe what he hears."
Tartuffe,4,6,"When Orgon accuses him of impiety, he flies off the handle – in the most reasonable way possible, of course – and tells Orgon what a dunce he is to believe in all of Tartuffe's righteous clap-trap."
Tartuffe,4,7,"Cléante makes it clear that he's no atheist – he simply knows the difference between truth and lies, real piety and hypocrisy. The difference between the two of them is, well, that Cléante isn't a gullible idiot. Cléante likes big, important terms like Nature and Reason and he, well, really likes to use them. A lot. He talks a lot."
Tartuffe,4,8,"Orgon makes some sarcastic remarks about how wise Cléante is, which only pushes him to speak some more. He talks more about the difference between true men of religion and hypocritical con artists and he names all sorts of obscure philosophers and thinkers to justify his claims."
Tartuffe,4,9,"He lists some key virtues which all good, Christian men should demonstrate: humility, good intentions, a desire to do good works, sincerity, humility, humility and…humility."
Tartuffe,4,10,"At this point, Orgon is sick to death of hearing Cléante lecture, and he asks if he can leave."
Tartuffe,4,11,"Cléante lets him go, but quickly gets him to come back."
Tartuffe,4,12,"He asks about the whole Mariane-Valère wedding thing, as per Damis's wishes."
Tartuffe,4,13,"Orgon tells him that, yes, he gave them his blessing and set a date. Cléante asks if he's now postponed it. Orgon has, but he won't say why. Cléante presses him until, finally, Orgon tells him that he plans ""to be guided by Heaven's will."""
Tartuffe,4,14,"This is not, Cléante knows, good news for Mariane and Valère."
Tartuffe,30,0,"Tartuffe shows up, with a police office in tow. He's got even worse news for Orgon: he's headed to prison."
Tartuffe,30,1,Orgon curses Tartuffe and calls him a villain.
Tartuffe,30,2,"Tartuffe pays no attention, saying that ""those who serve Heaven must expect abuse"" (5.7.3). He still hasn't given up his self-righteous act."
Tartuffe,30,3,"Cléante and Dorine insult Tartuffe, then Mariane, then Orgon again. He doesn't care; even when Orgon reminds him that he saved him from poverty, Tartuffe merely says that his ""first duty is to serve [his] King."" He would sacrifice his wife…family…friend…to serve him"" (5.7.10)."
Tartuffe,30,4,"Again, Elmire and Dorine insult Tartuffe. Cléante asks him where this newfound patriotic zeal came from, and wonders how he ""could condescend"" to be the heir of a traitor."
Tartuffe,30,5,Tartuffe pays no attention to this; he sics the police officer on Orgon.
Tartuffe,30,6,"Plot twist! The officer turns around and arrests…Tartuffe. Tartuffe is, of course, blown away."
Tartuffe,30,7,"The office turns to Orgon and explains himself. The King, it seems, is a little more with it than Orgon; he saw right through Tartuffe's little scheme. He's the kind of guy that Cléante would love: he knows true piety when he sees it, he's wise, and he has experience foiling these kind of liars. Oh, and as it turns out, this isn't the first time Tartuffe has tried to swindle someone; he's got a long criminal record, long enough to fill ""ten volumes and be writing still"" (5.7.19). He's a bad, bad, bad dude."
Tartuffe,30,8,"The officer gives Orgon back the papers from the strongbox, and declares that the deed Tartuffe had written up is invalid."
Tartuffe,30,9,"The King also pardons Orgon for hiding the papers, on account of his loyal deeds in the late civil war. Orgon a war hero? Whodathunkit?"
Tartuffe,30,10,Everyone breathes a sigh of relief and praises the Lord.
Tartuffe,30,11,"Except for Orgon. He begins to chew out Tartuffe, but luckily Cléante intervenes before he can say anything too stupid. He reminds Orgon that Tartuffe is already going to suffer for what he's done. Hopefully, he says, Tartuffe can actually find God, become a good person, and maybe get out on parole. You'd be better off, he tells Orgon, thanking the King for his kindness."
Tartuffe,30,12,And so Orgon lets bygones be bygones and gets ready to go see the King.
Tartuffe,30,13,"Once that's been done, he says, we can finally get Mariane and Valère married."
Tartuffe,30,14,And they all lived happily ever after.
Tartuffe,27,0,Monsieur Loyal enters. He's looking for the master of the house.
Tartuffe,27,1,"As it turns out, Loyal has been sent by Tartuffe."
Tartuffe,27,2,"Before going to meet him, Orgon asks Cléante for some advice. Cléante tells him that he just needs to keep a cool head."
Tartuffe,27,3,"When Loyal greets Orgon kindly, Orgon takes this as a sign of good will, and hopes Tartuffe is willing to compromise."
Tartuffe,27,4,"Instead, Loyal serves him with a writ, a written court document, calling for the eviction of Orgon and Co. from their own home."
Tartuffe,27,5,"Orgon can't believe it, so M. Loyal elaborates. The house, he tells Orgon, is now the property of Tartuffe. He produces a deed to prove it."
Tartuffe,27,6,"Hotheaded Damis attempts to intervene, but he's talked down by Loyal."
Tartuffe,27,7,"Loyal is sure that, with Orgon's compliance, everything will go off without a hitch. He tries to appeal to Orgon, to remind him that he is a wise and ""temperate"" man, and tells him that he loves ""all men of upright character."""
Tartuffe,27,8,Orgon appeals to Loyal.
Tartuffe,27,9,"Out of the kindness of his heart, Loyal agrees to give Orgon a reprieve…until the next day."
Tartuffe,27,10,"Loyal will, he tells Orgon, need to spend the night…and bring a bunch of men to move out stuff…and kick Orgon and everybody else out early in the morning, but he'll do it in the most pleasant way possible."
Tartuffe,27,11,At this point Orgon starts to lose his temper; he's ready to sock Loyal right in the nose.
Tartuffe,27,12,Cléante steps in and tells Orgon to chill.
Tartuffe,27,13,"Damis, of course, wants to kick his butt."
Tartuffe,27,14,And Dorine tells Loyal to his face that she'd like to see him whacked with a stick. Loyal warns that he might have to take her in if she continues to act like that.
Tartuffe,27,15,"Cléante tells Loyal to give him the paper and leave, which he does. Orgon curses him as he walks out the door."
Tartuffe,26,0,"Madame Pernelle, Mariane, Elmire, and Dorine show up."
Tartuffe,26,1,Madame Pernelle can't believe the stuff she's been hearing.
Tartuffe,26,2,"Orgon gets his mom up to speed on what's happened. He tells her how Tartuffe duped him, took his stuff, and tried to seduce his wife."
Tartuffe,26,3,Madame Pernelle still can't believe what she's hearing and she tells Orgon as much.
Tartuffe,26,4,Orgon is flabbergasted – he doesn't know how she can't see Tartuffe for what he is after hearing all that.
Tartuffe,26,5,"Orgon and his mother argue for a while; she insists that Tartuffe is good, and that he, Orgon, doesn't have enough proof of his guilt. This is what some people call ""getting a taste of your own medicine."""
Tartuffe,26,6,"Finally, Cléante tells them to cut it out. Tartuffe, they have to remember, is planning to take control of Orgon's estate."
Tartuffe,26,7,"Damis and Elmire don't think that Tartuffe has the guts to follow through, but Cléante isn't so sure."
Tartuffe,26,8,"He, Orgon, and Elmire are talking things through when…"
Tartuffe,1,0,Cléante and Dorine stay behind and discuss the situation.
Tartuffe,1,1,Cléante is amazed at how quickly Tartuffe has bamboozled Madame Pernelle.
Tartuffe,1,2,"Dorine agrees, but she's even more afraid of the way he's tricking Orgon. Though he was once a wise and prudent advisor to the king, he seems to have gone a bit soft in the noggin. Now, she says, he's obsessed with Tartuffe and ignores everyone else. Dorine points out that Tartuffe has been growing rich and fat thanks to his ignorance – this is what we literary types call exposition."
Tartuffe,0,0,"We find ourselves in Paris, inside the house of Orgon."
Tartuffe,0,1,"Madame Pernelle, Orgon's dear mama, is headed out the door, and fast. She's sick of what's going on in her son's house."
Tartuffe,0,2,"Everyone – meaning Elmire, Orgon's second wife, Damis, his son, Mariane, his daughter, and Cléante, his brother-in-law – try their best to get her to chill out. Nothing, however, can stop the old lady from complaining and hating on anything and everything."
Tartuffe,0,3,"It seems that Madame Pernelle is angry because her man Tartuffe gets no respect. She thinks he's a stand-up guy and totally righteous – generally, but most especially in the religious sense. But Elmire and company think he's just self-righteous, a total fake, a thief and, as the full title of the play suggests, a hypocrite."
Tartuffe,0,4,"Each member of the family has their own strategy for convincing Madame Pernelle: Damis just sort of gets angry, Elmire pleads, Cléante appeals to her reason, and Dorine, well…Dorine is, as you'd expect from a French maid, pretty saucy."
Tartuffe,0,5,"None of this works, of course. Madame Pernelle tells them they should all be grateful to have Tartuffe bossing them around and telling them how to live. As far as she's concerned, he's pretty much the ultimate life coach."
Tartuffe,0,6,"When Cléante snickers at her speech, Madame Pernelle tells him to shut up, slaps Flipote, her maid, in the face, and makes her exit, followed by most of the household."
Tartuffe,19,0,Elmire pulls up a table and tells Orgon to get underneath.
Tartuffe,19,1,"He's a little confused by the whole thing, but he eventually consents."
Tartuffe,19,2,"Elmire warns him that things are going to get a little bit weird, a bit shocking maybe, but that it's all an act. She's going to do her best to encourage Tartuffe, to fan the flames of his lust, as it were. You have the right to stop things whenever you've seen enough, she says, but before she can finish telling him…"
Tartuffe,18,0,Orgon comes in and interrupts their brainstorming session before it's even begun.
Tartuffe,18,1,He has the marriage contract in his hand and wants Mariane to sign it.
Tartuffe,18,2,"Mariane pleads with her father, asking him not to force the marriage upon her. She tells him that she'll hate her life."
Tartuffe,18,3,"The girl says, that if Orgon insists she not marry Valère, the least he could do is not force her to marry Tartuffe."
Tartuffe,18,4,"She alludes that if the marriage is forced on her she may take some unspecified ""desperate course"" (4.3.2)."
Tartuffe,18,5,"Orgon is moved a bit by her appeal, but he stands firm."
Tartuffe,18,6,"Mariane goes on, telling him that he can give Tartuffe his property and, if he wishes, her own inheritance, but that she would rather live in a convent than wed Tartuffe."
Tartuffe,18,7,"Orgon acts as though Mariane is just being a silly little girl. Then he drops a real bomb on her: the more you hate your husband, he says, the more virtuous you'll be!"
Tartuffe,18,8,"Dorine attempts to get a word in, but she's denied. As is Cléante."
Tartuffe,18,9,Elmire steps into the fray and tells Orgon what a gullible dope he is.
Tartuffe,18,10,"Orgon accuses her of being ""partial"" to Damis, implying that the whole thing was a ploy to discredit Tartuffe. If it were the real deal, he says, you should have been angrier."
Tartuffe,18,11,"Elmire resents Orgon's claims, and tells him that she prefers to play it cool. She's not a catty prude, she tells him, but a classy broad."
Tartuffe,18,12,"When Orgon still won't budge, Elmire tells him that she can show him that she, Damis, and everyone else is telling the truth."
Tartuffe,18,13,"Though Orgon resists, Elmire convinces him to at least give her a chance."
Tartuffe,18,14,"Elmire tells Dorine to fetch Tartuffe and gets everyone else, save Orgon, to leave the room."
Tartuffe,13,0,"When Orgon enters the room, Damis lets the cat out of the bag. He tells Orgon all about Tartuffe's ""adulterous offer,"" how Elmire was going to keep it a secret, and how he, Damis, just had to let Orgon know."
Tartuffe,13,1,"Elmire defends her position, tells Damis that he should have kept silent, and leaves."
Tartuffe,12,0,This is where things get a bit crazy.
Tartuffe,12,1,"Damis jumps out of the closet – remember, he's been hiding in there the whole time – and contradicts Elmire's promise."
Tartuffe,12,2,He wants to tell everyone about what a liar and a sleaze Tartuffe is; it's the second best thing to punching him in the face.
Tartuffe,12,3,Elmire tries to do some damage control and convince Damis to keep his mouth shut; she wants to honor her promise and avoid upsetting Orgon.
Tartuffe,12,4,"Damis can't imagine letting Tartuffe get off so easily. He, who has seen his marriage prospects nearly disappear, craves justice, and he's just had the perfect opportunity served up on a silver platter."
Tartuffe,12,5,"Elmire's attempts to calm him down fail; he wants only revenge, and he intends to get it."
Tartuffe,20,0,Tartuffe strolls into the room.
Tartuffe,20,1,"Elmire gets right to the point…but not before telling Tartuffe to close the door and ""look about for spies"" (4.5.2)."
Tartuffe,20,2,"He apparently doesn't look very well, as he fails to find Orgon."
Tartuffe,20,3,Elmire tells Tartuffe that she only acted the way she did earlier in the day because she was caught off guard.
Tartuffe,20,4,"Now that everything has blown over, she tells him, they can get busy without fear of interference."
Tartuffe,20,5,Tartuffe is justifiably confused by this turn of events.
Tartuffe,20,6,"Elmire tells him to chill out. If he didn't see what was going on, it's only because he doesn't understand what women want."
Tartuffe,20,7,"Women, according to Elmire always act coy; even when they say no, or perhaps especially when they say no, they really mean yes. (Note to all the dudes reading this: THIS IS NOT TRUE. Even Molière knew this was garbage.)"
Tartuffe,20,8,"Would I have listened to your whole confession of love, she asks, if I didn't, you know, want you? Would I have asked you to convince Orgon to let Mariane marry Valère if I didn't want to keep you all for myself?"
Tartuffe,20,9,"Despite the persuasiveness of her arguments – at least compared to those of Tartuffe – the trickster is still wary of being tricked. He won't believe her, he says, until she demonstrates her love ""somewhat more concretely."""
Tartuffe,20,10,"At this point, Elmire is getting a little creeped out. She coughs to let Orgon know that she's a bit uncomfortable."
Tartuffe,20,11,"Elmire tries to buy herself a little time, but Tartuffe won't let up. She tries again – but no luck. He's a veritable animal."
Tartuffe,20,12,"When Elmire pulls the whole ""Isn't this a sin?"" card, Tartuffe promises that he can clear the whole thing up with the Man Upstairs."
Tartuffe,20,13,"When she acts surprises, Tartuffe promises to teach her all his tricks, let's call it Hypocrisy 101. He also tells her that, if anything goes down, the fault will be his."
Tartuffe,20,14,This prompts Elmire to cough again. Tartuffe comments upon it and offers a piece of licorice to help her feel better. She declines.
Tartuffe,20,15,"Tartuffe tries to reassure Elmire again, telling her that, really, no one will know about what happens."
Tartuffe,20,16,"Elmire coughs again and then finally gives up. She tells Tartuffe that yes, clearly she has to ""demonstrate"" her love. Before anything happens, though, she asks Tartuffe to open the door and check for her husband."
Tartuffe,20,17,"Tartuffe tells her to chill out; he's got stupid Orgon wrapped around his finger, he says, and she needn't worry."
Tartuffe,20,18,"Still, she insists, and Tartuffe leaves the room."
Tartuffe,21,0,"Orgon comes out from under the table. He's fuming. He can't believe what a ""monster"" Tartuffe is (4.6.1)."
Tartuffe,21,1,Elmire tells him to go back under the table and wait until he's completely sure of Tartuffe's treachery.
Tartuffe,21,2,"She tells him to hide again, but he can only just manage to hide behind Elmire when…"
Tartuffe,6,0,Dorine shows up; Orgon accuses her of eavesdropping and tells her to buzz off.
Tartuffe,6,1,"Dorine says to Orgon, that the gossip around town is that he wants to Mariane to marry Tartuffe, The maid says that the idea is so silly she has to laugh."
Tartuffe,6,2,Orgon can't believe that Dorine can't believe that he would want Mariane to marry Tartuffe.
Tartuffe,6,3,The more he tries to convince her the more she mocks him.
Tartuffe,6,4,She tells Mariane that it's all just a hoax and that she shouldn't believe her father.
Tartuffe,6,5,Dorine finally drops the hoax thing and tells Orgon straight out that nobody can believe he's acting like such a twit. How could you have your daughter marry a man who claims to be so religious? And what about that whole poverty thing – Orgon's a rich gentleman after all.
Tartuffe,6,6,"Orgon tells Dorine that Tartuffe lost his ""earthly fortune"" because he was so occupied by heavenly things. He says Tartuffe needs only a little monetary support, in order to regain his estate (2.2.17). (Sound familiar? You may have received some junk mail to that effect.)"
Tartuffe,6,7,"Dorine tries another strategy. Wouldn't it be something of a strange match, she asks Orgon, considering that Mariane really doesn't like Tartuffe? Because, she says, when a bride doesn't like her groom, she usually cheats. Oh, and a father who gives her daughter to such a man will pay for his sins. Yeah, she really lays it on thick."
Tartuffe,6,8,"Orgon can't believe what he's hearing from the servant-girl; he tells Mariane to ignore Dorine. Oh, and it turns out that Valère gambles and doesn't go to church too often."
Tartuffe,6,9,Orgon tries to convince Mariane that he's doing the right thing.
Tartuffe,6,10,Dorine continues to make fun of him and Tartuffe.
Tartuffe,6,11,"She interrupts him again and again, until Orgon finally threatens to hit her."
Tartuffe,6,12,"The saucy servant immediately starts acting coy, making comments only when Orgon turns his back."
Tartuffe,6,13,"Orgon tries to hit her, but misses, and soon leaves the room in anger."
Tartuffe,7,0,Dorine criticizes Mariane for not taking a stand against her father.
Tartuffe,7,1,Mariane doesn't really have a good answer. She's just used to doing what she's told; she's done it for so long.
Tartuffe,7,2,"Dorine puts her on the spot. Do you love Valère, she asks, or don't you?"
Tartuffe,7,3,"Mariane is insulted for a bit, but then she tells Dorine how much she loves, really loves Valère, She says she would rather kill herself than marry Tartuffe."
Tartuffe,7,4,Dorine thinks this is just about the stupidest solution to the problem she can think of. She has no sympathy for that kind hopelessness. She tells Mariane to buck up.
Tartuffe,7,5,"When Mariane agonizes over disobeying her father, Dorine mocks her, telling her how great a husband Tartuffe will make for her, how much fun she'll have visiting her awful in-laws, etc."
Tartuffe,7,6,This is too much for Mariane to take; she falls into despair again.
Tartuffe,7,7,"This time, Dorine takes pity on her, and the two set about making a plan."
Tartuffe,14,0,"Orgon immediately asks Tartuffe if what Damis is saying is true. (Remember, the old hypocrite has been watching this whole thing unravel)."
Tartuffe,14,1,"Tartuffe tells Orgon that he is, in fact a bad guy, that he's awful, sinful, terrible, the worst person this side of Judas. He tells Orgon to believe what he has just been told, and to kick him to the curb, please. No, really."
Tartuffe,14,2,Orgon doesn't seem to hear what Tartuffe has said. He screams at Damis and calls him a liar.
Tartuffe,14,3,Damis can't believe it; he can't believe Tartuffe's little reverse psychology trick has worked. When he goes to reason with Orgon he's cut off.
Tartuffe,14,4,"Tartuffe steps in to defend Damis. He reiterates that he, Tartuffe, is full of it, a liar, a hypocrite, an awful human being."
Tartuffe,14,5,"He turns to Damis, kneels before him, and asks him to accuse him some more; he says that he deserves every last bit of punishment."
Tartuffe,14,6,Orgon comforts Tartuffe then turns and insults Damis.
Tartuffe,14,7,Damis tries to talk some sense into him.
Tartuffe,14,8,"Orgon insults his son, asks Tartuffe to stand up, then insults him again."
Tartuffe,14,9,This cycle repeats itself a few times until Tartuffe finally falls to his knees again and asks Orgon to pardon Damis.
Tartuffe,14,10,"Orgon is, of course, blown away by Tartuffe's kindness. He insults Damis some more, then declares that he'll have Mariane marry Tartuffe this night. He then asks Damis to kneel down and beg Tartuffe for forgiveness."
Tartuffe,14,11,"When Damis refuses to do this, Orgon threatens to beat him, then tells him to scram, for good, and never come back. Oh, and he disinherits him too."
Tartuffe,15,0,"Once Damis's out of the room, Tartuffe tells Orgon how awful Damis has made him feel."
Tartuffe,15,1,"Orgon runs to the doorway through which Damis has just exited and shakes his fist, cursing his son some more."
Tartuffe,15,2,"Tartuffe tells Orgon he simply has to leave, that he's caused too much trouble for everyone."
Tartuffe,15,3,"Again, Tartuffe proves himself a master of reverse psychology…or maybe just proves that Orgon is a buffoon. Or both."
Tartuffe,15,4,Orgon talks Tartuffe into staying – as if he really needed the encouragement.
Tartuffe,15,5,"When all that is settled, Tartuffe makes one more request: he tells Orgon that he simply must avoid Elmire, just in case, you know, something might happen."
Tartuffe,15,6,"Orgon will hear nothing of the sort. He wants to get back at his mean, deceitful relatives. In order to do so, he tells Tartuffe to spend as much time as possible with his wife. He also decides to make him ""his only son and heir""; he matters more, he tells Tartuffe, ""than wife, child or kin"" (3.7.21)."
Tartuffe,15,7,Tartuffe is cool with the arrangement; as far as he's concerned it's God's will.
Tartuffe,15,8,He and Orgon set off to write up the contract.
The Masque of the Red Death,0,0,"A horrible disease called the Red Death is ravaging the countryside. It's a terrible way to die: shooting pains, seizures, bleeding from all the pores, and then death. And it all happens within half an hour."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,1,"Prince Prospero, the ruler of said kingdom currently being ravaged by the Red Death, is ""happy"" and ""dauntless"" and decides he doesn't want to bother with the disease. So he takes a thousand of his knights and maidens and shuts himself up with them in a hidden ""castellated abbey"" (that would be an abbey made over into a castle, with battlements)."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,2,"The doors of the abbey are welded shut, so no one can get in. But no one can get out, either."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,3,"Prince Prospero is quite the party animal, and plans to have a good time while the rest of the world dies."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,4,"The abbey (which Prospero designed himself) is filled to the brim with all the makings of an incredible party: lots of food, jesters, dancers, musicians, and wine."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,5,"Five or six months after shutting himself up, Prince Prospero decides to have the biggest, weirdest masked ball anyone's ever seen. The narrator can't get over just how cool the setup is, and spends the next two pages raving about it. So, here's the setup:"
The Masque of the Red Death,0,6,"The ball is set in a suite of seven rooms, which run from east to west. Unlike most suites, they don't form a straight line, but are at odd angles to each other."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,7,"Each room is a different color, too (thanks to a serious job on the wall hangings) – even the windows in the rooms are painted. The first room is blue, the second one purple, the third one green, the fourth one orange, the fifth white, the sixth violet."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,8,"The seventh room is particularly interesting. It's hung entirely in black velvet, but the windows aren't black: instead, they're a deep blood red color. Mwahahaha…how ghoulish."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,9,"As for the lighting? The windows of the rooms open on to a corridor, and the candles are actually put in the corridor, so the light can stream through the windows into the rooms."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,10,This lighting makes the black room so creepy that almost no one dares to go in.
The Masque of the Red Death,0,11,In the black room there's also an enormous black clock.
The Masque of the Red Death,0,12,"The clock chimes at every hour with a note so strange that all the masqueraders are put on edge and stop whatever they're doing when they hear it, even the musicians. After the clock finishes, they all laugh nervously and go back to partying."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,13,"After describing the duke's designs, the narrator admits that our man Prospero's a little on the odd side. So odd, in fact, that you might think he was insane, though his friends don't think so. But he does know how to throw one heck of a party."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,14,"The party is one wild good time – it feels like a fantasy land. The masqueraders look like ""dreams"" and ""fantasms."" General revelry for all."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,15,"The night wears on, and gradually the revelers get too nervous to even venture a foot into the black and red room. The other rooms are jam-packed with people."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,16,"Midnight arrives, and the clock strikes twelve eerie strokes. Everybody stops what they're doing, as usual."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,17,"Before the clock's done striking, some of the revelers start to notice a new guest has arrived, a guest who even in Prospero's crazy crowd seems to have gone just a little too far…"
The Masque of the Red Death,0,18,"The new arrival is dressed like a corpse in a burial shroud, with a terribly convincing mask that looks just like a dead person's face."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,19,"If that were all, it wouldn't be such a big deal. But this guy's not just dressed like a corpse; he's dressed like someone who died of the Red Death. You can tell by the blood."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,20,"Prince Prospero catches sight of the ""spectral image"" (ghostly figure), who's walking slowly and deliberately through the crowd. His first reaction is terror, but then he gets mad."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,21,"Prospero demands to know who would dare to insult him so, and orders his guards to seize the guy in the Red Death getup, and unmask him – he'll be publicly hanged at sunrise."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,22,No one has the courage to seize the guest. Including Prospero.
The Masque of the Red Death,0,23,"The Red Death masquerader passes right by Prince Prospero, who's in the blue room, and slowly makes his way from one room to another, heading towards the black room. Everybody shrinks away as he passes."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,24,"Now Prospero's angry enough to get over his nervousness. In rage, he draws a knife and runs after the ghostly figure in the Red Death getup."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,25,"Prospero passes from the blue room all the way down to the violet room, until he reaches the ghostly guest at the edge of the black room."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,26,"The Red Death masquerader suddenly turns around and faces Prospero, who drops his dagger and falls down. Dead."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,27,"Prospero's revelers, enraged enough to get over their fear, run into the black room and mob the masquerader."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,28,"As they rip at it, they're horrified to discover that there's nothing underneath the mask and shroud. Uh oh. You know what that means…"
The Masque of the Red Death,0,29,Everyone realizes that the Red Death itself has arrived at the party.
The Masque of the Red Death,0,30,"Slowly, one by one, each person starts contorting, bleeding, and dying."
The Masque of the Red Death,0,31,"The black clock dies too, and the candles go out…"
The Masque of the Red Death,0,32,"""And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all"" (14)."
Richard III,10,0,"The queen's brother Earl Rivers, her son Lord Gray, and their friend Sir Thomas Vaughn face their executions at Pomfret."
Richard III,10,1,"Rivers declares they're all dying for their duty, and Vaughn declares that all who live after this will regret it."
Richard III,10,2,Gray notes that their execution seems to fulfill the old Queen Margaret's curse. She had railed against them for standing by and watching Richard murder her child.
Richard III,10,3,"Rivers points out that Margaret's curse wasn't only directed at them; Richard, Hastings, and Buckingham were also included. (Actually, Gray and Buckingham weren't included in Margaret's curses, and Buckingham was only warned.)"
Richard III,10,4,"Rivers calls out to God in the hopes that Richard, Hastings, and Buckingham will also receive their parts of the curse. Rivers also prays that his and his colleagues' wrongly spilled blood will somehow spare his sister, Queen Elizabeth, and her children."
Richard III,11,0,The time has come for one of Richard's council meetings.
Richard III,11,1,"Before Richard arrives, those assembled confirm the purpose of the meeting: to discuss the coronation date of the young King Edward (the day he'll actually be crowned). They've already settled on the following day, so they're just waiting for Richard to show up and speak his mind."
Richard III,11,2,Richard shows up late and sends the Bishop of Ely off to go collect some strawberries for him.
Richard III,11,3,Next he draws Buckingham aside for a private conference about Hastings' unwillingness to join their scheme.
Richard III,11,4,Richard and Buckingham decide to exit and talk privately for a bit.
Richard III,11,5,Ely returns with the strawberries just in time to hear Stanley and Hastings talking. Hastings declares that Richard is a really sweet guy and seems happy – there's no way he's angry with anyone in the room.
Richard III,11,6,"Richard returns with Buckingham, acting like he's in a rage. Richard claims that his physical deformity is the result of witchcraft. He offers up his limp arm as evidence that Queen Elizabeth and Mistress Shore have been conspiring to wither him and potentially even kill him."
Richard III,11,7,(Richard knows he's full of it. He already told us that his arm has been deformed since birth.)
Richard III,11,8,"Richard accuses Hastings of sympathizing and conspiring with Queen Elizabeth and Jane Shore, which constitutes treason."
Richard III,11,9,Richard orders Hastings' execution.
Richard III,11,10,Hastings boo-hoos that Margaret's curse against him has come true.
Richard III,11,11,"Ratcliffe is all, ""Hurry up and stop crying – Richard can't have dinner until you're dead."""
Richard III,11,12,"Hastings screams, ""O bloody Richard! Miserable England!"" and then declares that all of his enemies are going to die soon anyway."
Richard III,8,0,"On a London street, Buckingham and Richard talk with young Prince Edward, who has just arrived in the city."
Richard III,8,1,The young Prince asks why his other uncles have not come to greet him. (He has no idea they've been locked up at Pomfret Castle.)
Richard III,8,2,Richard talks trash about them and says little Edward is better off without those guys.
Richard III,8,3,"The Prince is greeted by the mayor of London, and he's left to wonder why his mother isn't there on the street with the city's welcoming committee."
Richard III,8,4,Just then Lord Hastings enters and explains that Queen Elizabeth is in hiding.
Richard III,8,5,"Buckingham dismisses the queen's sanctuary as nonsense and instructs Cardinal Bourchier to go persuade the queen to release her youngest son so he can watch his brother be crowned king. As backup, he suggests Hastings go along to forcibly take the boy, should his mother refuse."
Richard III,8,6,"The Cardinal balks at Buckingham's suggestion – sanctuary is a sacred right. (According to the rules of sanctuary, if you were being hunted by The Man, you could escape into a church or holy place and they couldn't come after you.)"
Richard III,8,7,"Buckingham, so as not to seem the kind of jerk that breaks sacred rights, jumps through some logical hoops. He argues that the queen may have invoked sanctuary, but her son didn't invoke it for himself, and certainly didn't do anything to need it – so taking him out of sanctuary isn't actually blasphemous."
Richard III,8,8,"The Cardinal, because he's kind of a pushover, is persuaded by Buckingham's logic and goes with Hastings to collect the boy."
Richard III,8,9,"Prince Edward wonders where he should stay until his coronation day. His Uncle Richard suggests staying at the Tower of London, one of the strongest fortresses around."
Richard III,8,10,"Little Edward thinks this is a bad idea. (The Tower, after all, is also a prison.)"
Richard III,8,11,Richard mutters under his breath that Edward doesn't have long to live.
Richard III,8,12,Prince Edward talks about how he admires Julius Caesar (the Roman leader who was stabbed in the back by his frenemies). Edward hopes he'll be a brave king.
Richard III,8,13,"Hastings and the Cardinal return with Prince Edward's young, snarky brother, the Duke of York."
Richard III,8,14,"Together the two boys are a juggernaut of wit, and they get on Richard's nerves."
Richard III,8,15,"Finally the young Duke of York says he doesn't want to stay at the Tower of London because he knows his uncle, George of Clarence, was jailed and murdered there."
Richard III,8,16,There's some uncomfortable joking about whether or not the little princes should be afraid of any of their living uncles (like Richard).
Richard III,8,17,Finally the boys exit with a crowd to go to the Tower.
Richard III,8,18,"Left alone, Richard, Buckingham, and Catesby confer, first over what a cheeky pain little York is, and then over their grand plan for Richard to become the next king of England."
Richard III,8,19,"Catesby says he doesn't think Hastings is going to be down with their plan to do away with Prince Edward. Hastings hates the queen's family, but he really loved the Prince's father, the late Edward IV."
Richard III,8,20,Catesby is also sure Lord Stanley will do whatever Hastings does.
Richard III,8,21,Buckingham wants Catesby to try to get Hastings on their side anyway.
Richard III,8,22,Buckingham's plan for the next day is to hold two councils: one to discuss Prince Edward's coronation and another secret council to discuss how Richard might steal the crown.
Richard III,8,23,Richard wants the queen's captured family members killed at Pomfret castle the next day.
Richard III,8,24,"Catesby promises to bring back news to Richard's pad, Crosby House, and he exits to do his task."
Richard III,8,25,Buckingham wonders what will happen if Hastings won't go along with their plan.
Richard III,8,26,"In a famous line, Richard gleefully declares that if Hastings doesn't comply, they will simply ""Chop off his head!"""
Richard III,8,27,"Even though Richard isn't the king yet, he promises to give Buckingham the earldom of Hereford for his faithful service."
Richard III,8,28,Richard and Buckingham run off to have a snack.
Richard III,9,0,Lord Hastings is sleeping peacefully at home when he's awoken by a messenger knocking loudly at his door at four in the morning.
Richard III,9,1,"The messenger brings news from Lord Stanley, who is a bit of a wreck. Stanley had a nightmare about a boar (Richard's heraldic symbol) that knocked off his helmet and cut off his head."
Richard III,9,2,Stanley's also worried because he's gotten wind of the two councils to be held. He's worried that something terrible is going to happen and wants to run away to the north.
Richard III,9,3,"Hastings tells the messenger to tell Stanley to quit being a paranoid baby. Even if there are two councils, their boy Catesby has got their back and will warn them if they're in danger."
Richard III,9,4,"Catesby enters with news that Richard wants the crown. Hastings is like, ""over my dead body!"""
Richard III,9,5,"Catesby says to himself, ""You're as good as dead, have it your way."""
Richard III,9,6,"Catesby also adds the news that some of the queen's family members are to be executed at Pomfret castle this very day. While Hastings is stoked to hear this news about his enemies, it's not enough to move him to support Richard in taking the crown from young Prince Edward."
Richard III,9,7,Hastings can't quite bring himself to believe that Richard would harm his close friends.
Richard III,9,8,He has a private chat with a public official empowered to serve warrants.
Richard III,9,9,"Hastings reveals that he's actually happy to gloat over the death of his enemies, the queen's family members. He sends the official off with some money and is then met by a priest, with whom he conducts some secret business."
Richard III,9,10,Buckingham walks in on this whispered meeting and jokes that the guys scheduled for execution need the priest more than Hastings does (referring to the need to be absolved by a priest in confession before death).
Richard III,9,11,"In an aside, Buckingham clues us in to the fact that Hastings will be imprisoned and executed in the Tower of London."
Richard III,9,12,The unsuspecting Hastings goes along with Buckingham to the Tower of London for dinner.
Richard III,24,0,"Back at Richard's camp at Bosworth Field, Richard is also making preparations for battle. He is not focused on troop movements or even the well-being of the army. Instead, he asks about his own personal gear: his helmet, swords, horse, and armor (evidence, perhaps, that in his mind the battle is all about him). Even when talking about his own men, Richard is more ready to threaten than to encourage."
Richard III,24,1,"Richard sends Catesby to tell Stanley to bring his troops before sunrise, emphasizing that Stanley's son's life hangs in the balance."
Richard III,24,2,Richard then calls for wine and hears the news that some other noblemen have gone through the camps trying to cheer and motivate the troops (something Richard didn't see fit to do himself).
Richard III,24,3,"Richard gets his wine and calls for ink and paper. His last instructions are to Ratcliffe, who should come and arm him in the early morning."
Richard III,24,4,"Then, instead of doing any crunch-time writing or planning for the battle, Richard goes to bed and falls asleep right away."
Richard III,24,5,"Back at Richmond's camp, Richmond's stepfather Stanley has arrived for a secret meeting. The two greet each other lovingly, and Stanley gives Richmond the inside scoop that he should be prepared for battle very, very early."
Richard III,24,6,"Stanley says he'll try to do whatever he can to help Richmond by misleading Richard's forces. He has to appear to fight on Richard's side, though, or else the king will kill Richmond's stepbrother, George Stanley."
Richard III,24,7,Richmond thanks Stanley warmly and has him escorted back to his regiment.
Richard III,24,8,"Then Richmond does the opposite of what Richard did. He doesn't drink, and, having done all his homework, lies down to get as much sleep as possible so he'll be well rested for his big day tomorrow."
Richard III,24,9,"As if he weren't already perfect enough, Richmond says his prayers before bed. He talks to God, reiterating that he's humbly in His service. He also asks that God bless his men so they can crush their foes with irons of wrath."
Richard III,24,10,"We then get a parade of ghosts. Richard has had a hand in the murder of each of the eleven ghosts who show up, being, in order of their murder and appearance: Prince Edward (son of Henry VI), King Henry VI, Clarence, Rivers, Gray, Vaughn, the two young princes Edward and York, Hastings, Lady Anne, and Buckingham."
Richard III,24,11,"Each ghost speaks to Richard and then Richmond, and with some variance they establish a general pattern. They each describe who they are and the circumstances of their death to Richard. They often go on to wish or prophesy that Richard be killed in battle the next day. Most important, every one of the ghosts also tells Richard to, in so many words, ""Despair and die!"""
Richard III,24,12,"After each ghost speaks with Richard, it makes its way to Richmond to deliver a counterbalancing speech of hope, love, and encouragement. Richmond is hailed as England's new king and father to a race of kings."
Richard III,24,13,"After their speeches, the eleven ghosts vanish from the stage. Richard wakes up out of his sleep in a fit, crying for Jesus' mercy."
Richard III,24,14,"As soon as Richard realizes it was only a dream, he curses that he is ""afflicted"" by his ""coward conscience."" Still, he notes a blue burning light (which was thought to symbolize the presence of ghosts)."
Richard III,24,15,"Richard can rationalize all he wants, but he feels fear and then tries to figure out why. Perhaps he fears himself? Of course not...or maybe. Perhaps, he wonders, he fears a murderer? There are no murderers there...except for himself. He briefly muses that perhaps he's seeking revenge against himself, but quickly dismisses this thought, knowing that he loves himself."
Richard III,24,16,"Ultimately, Richard confesses that he's guilty of almost every sin in the book: deceit, murder, and beyond. He knows he's a villain, and he knows no one will pity him. He's quite comfortable with this though; no one can pity a man who does not pity himself, and King Richard does not pity himself."
Richard III,24,17,"Still, he knows he dreamed that the next day's battle would be his last."
Richard III,24,18,"Richard is interrupted in his musings by Ratcliffe, who startles him. Richard cries ""Zounds!"" (a mild oath meaning ""God's wounds!"")."
Richard III,24,19,"Richard is still shaken. He tries to tell Ratcliffe about his troublesome nightmare. He asks Ratcliffe if he thinks their friends will stay true on this day. (We're not sure which friends Richard means, since he's killed most of them.)"
Richard III,24,20,"Ratcliffe tells Richard to shake it off, and Richard seems to laugh a little at himself – one dream did more to unsettle him than Richmond and his whole army."
Richard III,24,21,"We then turn to Richmond. Richmond apologizes for staying in bed so long. He says he had a great dream that featured a horde of ghosts of murdered people, all of whom were encouraging him. Richmond is stoked that all Richard's victims are on his side. (Dead men may tell no tales, but they sure can inspire confidence.)"
Richard III,24,22,"Richmond gives a stirring speech to his men as they get ready to head into battle. He reminds them that they're fighting for God and a good cause. He reiterates that Richard is a bloody tyrant who doesn't belong on the throne of England, so they should do the godly thing and kill him."
Richard III,24,23,"Finally, Richmond humbly says that if he fails in this war, his penalty will be his own death on the battlefield. But if they win, the victory will be shared by even the lowest among them."
Richard III,24,24,"With some rousing drums and trumpets, Richmond leads his troops into battle."
Richard III,25,0,"As Richmond takes to the field, Richard is still trying to get the weather report. He notes that the sun should have risen an hour ago but has yet to show. With the sun hiding and the sky crying, Richard thinks it's shaping up to be a bad day."
Richard III,25,1,"Still, Richard figures the same heaven is looking over Richmond, so maybe a dark day is in store for everyone."
Richard III,25,2,"Richard moves to gather his men and hastily throws out their battle plan. John, Duke of Norfolk then shows Richard a note that was stuck onto his tent, amounting to ""You guys are done for, and no one will stay on your side."""
Richard III,25,3,"Richard chooses to ignore the message (because what else is he going to do, give up?) and proceeds to give a little speech suggesting that conscience is for cowards. Essentially, Richard would have his men rely on their brass and brawn."
Richard III,25,4,"Richard's pep talk to the troops essentially consists of, ""They're coming from France [Bretons, from Brittany] and Wales. We're English. Hello, we'll crush them!"""
Richard III,25,5,"Richard calls Richmond a ""milksop"" and suggests that their duty as Englishman is to do what their forefathers have long done before them: to defeat those sniveling cowards."
Richard III,25,6,"Richard is interrupted in his speech by the entrance of a messenger bringing news that Lord Stanley has no intention of bringing his troops to battle. Since there isn't time right now to kill George Stanley, Richard will have to do it after the battle."
Richard III,25,7,"He leads his men off with the ""spleen of fiery dragons."""
Richard III,2,0,"At the royal palace of Westminster, Queen Elizabeth (the wife of the current King Edward IV) is wringing her hands because her husband is at death's door. Like any devoted wife, Elizabeth wants to know what's going to happen to her if her husband dies."
Richard III,2,1,"Dorset and Gray (her two sons from her previous marriage) try to cheer her up, but Elizabeth is inconsolable."
Richard III,2,2,"To make matters worse, Elizabeth points out that when her husband dies, evil Richard will become the guardian of their young son, who is set to inherit the crown but is a bit too young to rule. In other words, Richard will have way too much power and way too much access to her little boy."
Richard III,2,3,"Two noblemen enter: Buckingham and Lord Stanley, the Earl of Derby."
Richard III,2,4,"Queen Elizabeth has lukewarm greetings for Derby. He is the third husband of the Countess Richmond, and apparently that lady has been spreading nasty rumors about the queen. The queen promises she doesn't hold this against Derby, but she subtly suggests that he might want to put a leash on his wife."
Richard III,2,5,"(This is a seemingly random aside, but you should know that the Countess Richmond's son from her first marriage is Edmund Tudor, Earl of Richmond, who will eventually come to the throne as Henry VII. He's also the grandfather of Queen Elizabeth I, patron of Shakespeare.)"
Richard III,2,6,"The noblemen report that they've just come from visiting King Edward IV, who seems to be doing much better. He'd like to call a meeting between his brother Richard and the queen's brothers to heal the animosity between them."
Richard III,2,7,"The queen is skeptical, and though she says she'd like to be hopeful about this meeting, she fears things will only go downhill from here."
Richard III,2,8,"Just then Richard enters in a rage. He's furious about the news he's just heard about the king's meeting, because it suggests that he hates the queen's kinsmen, which he says is a lie (though in fact it's quite true)."
Richard III,2,9,"Richard says he's never done anything to the queen's men to suggest that he hates them, and that now is really not the time to be pouring this kind of poison into the sick king's ear. The queen begs to differ; she says it's clear that Richard envies the advancement of her and her friends, so the king's meeting is a good idea."
Richard III,2,10,"Richard then rails against Elizabeth, claiming that Clarence was imprisoned upon her urging, and that it's also her fault that Lord Hastings was recently jailed. Richard continues to curse her for marrying his brother and collecting the rewards, while disgracing the rightful nobles."
Richard III,2,11,Queen Elizabeth complains about Richard's abuse and says she'd rather be a country maid than the queen under these conditions. (Richard would probably rather it be that way too.)
Richard III,2,12,"Meanwhile, the former Queen Margaret, the widow of King Henry VI (who was recently killed by Richard) enters unnoticed. She's muttering under her breath, bitterly lamenting what she sees as Elizabeth's theft of her crown, not to mention Richard's murder of her husband and son, Edward Prince of Wales."
Richard III,2,13,"Richard, meanwhile, is filling us in on the family history. Apparently, while Richard was busy fighting the Lancaster family so his brother Edward would be made king, Elizabeth was married to Lord Gray, who fought on the Lancaster side against the Yorks (Edward and Richard). Lord Gray was killed in the battle at Saint Albion's, which undid the Lancasters and gave Edward of York the English crown. When Edward and the Yorks came out victorious, Elizabeth married Edward, effectively switching sides to the Yorks, and trading up big-time. Her brother Lord Rivers followed suit."
Richard III,2,14,"Richard also notes that his other brother, Clarence, was a traitor too – he married Isabella of Lancaster (sister of Lady Anne in this play) and switched temporarily over to the Lancaster side before returning to the Yorks."
Richard III,2,15,Richard again complains that poor Clarence has been imprisoned (though we know Richard is actually the cause of Clarence's imprisonment).
Richard III,2,16,"Lord Rivers, brother to Queen Elizabeth (and beneficiary of all her good fortunes) tries to say that he and his sister are not really traitors – they were just doing the loyal thing by following whoever happened to be King at the time. So really, though they seem like opportunistic snakes, they're model citizens of England."
Richard III,2,17,"The old Queen Margaret has been muttering bitterly to herself this whole time, cursing everyone within spitting distance. She finally steps forward and says she can no longer be silent."
Richard III,2,18,"Margaret calls everybody present ""wrangling pirates."" She also declares that Queen Elizabeth owes her a throne and that Richard owes her a husband and son (whom Richard murdered)."
Richard III,2,19,"Richard calls her a ""foul wrinkled witch"" and asks what the heck she's doing here."
Richard III,2,20,"Richard points out that nobody should be feeling sorry for Queen Margaret because, back in the day, Margaret did some pretty nasty things. (FYI: In Shakespeare's play Henry VI, Part 3, she taunted Richard's dad by putting a paper crown on his head and waving a bloody handkerchief in his face. By the way, the handkerchief was dipped in his son Rutland's blood, which is why Richard's dad cursed Margaret.)"
Richard III,2,21,"Richard points out that it's ""God"" who ""hath plagued [Margaret's] bloody deed."" In other words, God's making sure Margaret gets what she deserves. (Get your highlighters out, because this is important.)"
Richard III,2,22,"Everyone in the room begins to gang up on Margaret, kind of like a pack of wild dogs. (What else do we expect from the family at the center of the Wars of the Roses?)"
Richard III,2,23,"Queen Margaret lashes out with a few curses of her own: she hopes Queen Elizabeth's young son Edward (in line to be the king) will be struck down, the same way her young son Edward was struck down. Margaret also hopes that Queen Elizabeth will live to see all her children die and some other woman take the throne from her. Then Margaret also curses Hastings, Rivers, and Dorset to die some nasty unnatural death, as she says they stood by and witnessed her son Edward murdered at Tewksbury."
Richard III,2,24,"But Queen Margaret saves the worst curses for Richard of Gloucester. She says she hopes his life will be plagued by suspicion: that he will always suspect his friends as traitors, and that only traitors will be his closest friends."
Richard III,2,25,"Without coming up for air, Margaret rattles off some of the nastiest insults in Western literature, calling Richard an ""elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog,"" a ""slave of nature and the son of hell,"" a ""slander of thy mother's heavy womb,"" and so on."
Richard III,2,26,"Richard stops Margaret's rant by pulling the old ""I know you are but what am I"" trick. Here's how: Just as she starts to say ""thou detested..."" Richard interrupts her and yells out ""Margaret!"""
Richard III,2,27,"Margaret tries to warn Buckingham that Richard will betray him eventually, but Buckingham isn't having any of this."
Richard III,2,28,"Richard pretends to defend Margaret. He says he understands why Margaret is so upset, especially after everything she's suffered. He plays the martyr, seemingly taking the high road and forgiving the woman who curses him."
Richard III,2,29,"As everyone is marveling at Richard's charity, Catesby, a nobleman, enters with the news that King Edward IV has called everyone to come see him."
Richard III,2,30,"Everyone leaves except Richard, who stays behind and tells us his evil plan to have his imprisoned brother Clarence murdered. Not so kind and charitable after all, eh?"
Richard III,2,31,"Richard gloats over the fact that he's been able to convince Derby, Hastings, and Buckingham that Clarence's imprisonment is the fault of Queen Elizabeth and her supporters."
Richard III,2,32,"Richard is interrupted by the entrance of two murderers. They've shown up to collect Clarence's death warrant. Richard hands over the paper, making it absolutely clear that he's behind the plot to kill Clarence."
Richard III,2,33,Richard instructs the murderers to be quick with the execution so Clarence doesn't get a chance to talk them out of it.
Richard III,2,34,The murderers promise to do their job quickly and mercilessly.
Richard III,2,35,"Richard says, ""I like you lads"" and sends them on their way."
Richard III,3,0,"We cut to George, Duke of Clarence, imprisoned in the Tower of London."
Richard III,3,1,"Clarence tells the prison-keeper about a nightmare he had the night before. He dreamed he'd escaped from the Tower and was on a ship with his brother Richard, on their way to Burgundy, France (where the two were sent as boys for safety after their father was murdered)."
Richard III,3,2,"In the dream, Richard convinced Clarence to come up to the loose planks that made up the deck. From there the two looked toward England and recounted all the bad things that had happened to them during the long war between the Yorks and the Lancasters. Just then, Richard tumbled, and though Clarence was trying to steady him, Richard actually knocked his brother down, forcing him overboard."
Richard III,3,3,"Clarence dreamed of falling slowly through the sea. Though he felt the pain of drowning, it took a really long time for him to die, so he had plenty of time to witness all sorts of awful things under the sea: old shipwrecks, the bodies of drowned men that had been gnawed on by fish, sunken treasure, and so forth."
Richard III,3,4,"Finally Clarence died in the dream, but that didn't end all the agony. Instead, Clarence dreamed he passed over the mythological River Styx into death, and as he reached the underworld, he met his father-in-law, the Lancaster supporter, who cursed him for his double treachery. Not to be outdone, the man whom Clarence helped murder at Tewksbury, Prince Edward of Wales, also showed up and cursed Clarence, who was then seized by hell's minions. Fortunately, hell's minions are a rather rowdy bunch, and they made enough noise to wake Clarence from his dream."
Richard III,3,5,"Clarence, still talking to the prison guard, laments that all of his sinning was to help his brother Edward, and Edward rewarded him by having him locked away. He prays that if God wants to punish him for his evil deeds, fine, but he hopes God will spare his wife and children."
Richard III,3,6,"Having asked for his family's protection, Clarence readies to sleep again and asks the guard to sit by him awhile."
Richard III,3,7,"No sooner than Clarence sleeps does Brackenbury, the Lieutenant, join the prison guard. Brackenbury makes a pretty speech about how fleeting powerful titles are, and how little they mean."
Richard III,3,8,"He's interrupted by the two murderers, who say they're there to ""guard"" Clarence."
Richard III,3,9,"Brackenbury says OK, but runs off to tell the king that he's surrendered the watch over Clarence."
Richard III,3,10,"Though the two new guards do intend to murder Clarence, the business is not as straightforward as it had first seemed."
Richard III,3,11,"The second murderer hesitates to kill Clarence in his sleep, and this pause inspires a long talk between the two murderers about conscience. The second murderer claims he isn't afraid of killing Clarence, but he does fear the judgment he knows will follow. Though they have a commission for the murder, no commission can free them from damnation."
Richard III,3,12,"All of this back-and-forth is easily quashed when the first murderer reminds the second murderer that, conscience be damned, this is a very well-paying job. The debate about the virtues of conscience is settled by the decision to kill Clarence and then leave the body in a vat of wine."
Richard III,3,13,"Then Clarence wakes up and basically asks, ""Have you guys come to murder me?"" to which the murderers reply, ""Yes."" Clarence thinks they must not be serious, as they seem rather undecided about their chosen career paths as assassins."
Richard III,3,14,"Clarence then tries to reason with them – though they claim to follow the order of the king, Clarence tells them they'll be judged ultimately by the king of Kings (read: God)."
Richard III,3,15,Clarence suggests that they wouldn't want to follow the king's order knowing it defied God's order not to kill.
Richard III,3,16,"The murderers point out that actually, whatever their eternal fate is, Clarence will share it. After all, Clarence murdered the Lancastrian Prince Edward of Wales, though he had sworn to protect him (betraying his own family of York in the process)."
Richard III,3,17,"Clarence claims he only murdered to help out his brother, King Edward. Anyway, Clarence would like the murderers to go see his other brother, Richard of Gloucester, as Clarence is sure Richard will straighten the whole thing out."
Richard III,3,18,"The first murderer reveals to Clarence that Richard isn't a likely source of help, seeing as he was the one who sent the murderers."
Richard III,3,19,"Poor Clarence. He doesn't believe them at first, but he's soon pleading for his life."
Richard III,3,20,"The second murderer seems moved by Clarence's pleas. Still, his tender feelings for Clarence aren't enough to stop his partner from stabbing Clarence and then drowning his body in a big vat of wine for good measure."
Richard III,3,21,"Though the second murderer is repentant, the deed is done, and the two flee."
Richard III,17,0,"Tyrrell, the murderer, arrives back at the palace in London and reports that the two princes are dead."
Richard III,17,1,"Tyrrell says he feels guilty and explains that he hired two hit men, Dighton and Forrest, to smother the kids in their sleep. Even the hit men felt bad about offing two little kids."
Richard III,17,2,Richard thinks this is the best news he's ever heard.
Richard III,17,3,"Tyrrell reports that he saw the kids and is certain they're dead, though he doesn't know where they're buried."
Richard III,17,4,"(Brain Snack: The real historical mystery of what happened to the little boys is still unsolved, and it's unclear who really murdered the princes.)"
Richard III,17,5,Richard promises to reward Tyrrell handsomely.
Richard III,17,6,"In his usual style of giving the audience useful information, Richard fills us in: he's imprisoned Clarence's young son, married off Clarence's daughter to some harmless guy, and killed Edward's sons. Oh, and his wife Anne is dead. (What?! Yeah, that's all we get about Anne. Historically, the circumstances surrounding the actual Lady Anne's death are unclear.)"
Richard III,17,7,Richard reveals that he knows Richmond is also after young Elizabeth's hand (remember Edward's random daughter that Richard wants to marry?). Richard declares he'll be off to woo Elizabeth for himself.
Richard III,17,8,"Ratcliffe (who, as his name suggests, is like a rodent for still being allied to Richard) enters with the bad news that Morton Bishop of Ely has actually turned tail and joined Richmond's side. Buckingham is also waiting for Richard on the battlefield, backed by a horde of intimidating Welshmen."
Richard III,17,9,"Richard declares that Buckingham doesn't scare him, but this Richmond/Ely alliance is bad news."
Richard III,17,10,"Either way, Richard says he won't waste time lamenting. He's ready to get his battle on."
Richard III,16,0,"Back at the palace, Richard has taken the throne, but he's super paranoid."
Richard III,16,1,Richard worries aloud that his glory might be too short as king. He points out that Prince Edward (the rightful heir to the throne) is still alive and is a threat to him.
Richard III,16,2,Richard obviously wants Buckingham to make the young princes disappear – forever.
Richard III,16,3,"When it's clear that Buckingham isn't taking the hint, Richard declares, verbatim, ""I wish the bastards dead!"""
Richard III,16,4,"Buckingham hesitates, which ticks off Richard."
Richard III,16,5,"Buckingham quickly excuses himself, saying he needs a minute to think about whether it's OK to murder two innocent children."
Richard III,16,6,"Richard calls a page to bring him a man who will do anything, no matter how heinous, for money. The page knows just the man – Sir James Tyrrell."
Richard III,16,7,"Since Richard has now found a murderer and conspirator more useful to him than Buckingham, he declares Buckingham is out of his inner-circle. (And likely soon to be dead.)"
Richard III,16,8,"Stanley, Earl of Derby then enters with the news that Dorset has fled to see Richmond. (Remember that Richmond is Stanley's stepson, so we don't really know whose side he's on.)"
Richard III,16,9,"Richard doesn't fixate on this news. Instead, without hesitation, he calls Catesby to him and hatches yet another plot, this time to protect his hard-earned crown. Richard wants Catesby to start spreading a rumor that his wife Anne is very sick and likely to die soon. Meanwhile, he plans to imprison Anne."
Richard III,16,10,"Richard plans to get Clarence's kids out of the way too – just to be safe. He isn't worried about Clarence's dull-witted young son, and he'll marry Clarence's little daughter Margaret off to some unimportant loser, probably to prevent a nobleman from marrying her and then claiming himself heir to the crown."
Richard III,16,11,"Richard then reveals the worst part of his plan. Once the hired murderer snuffs out the two princes in the tower, only their sister will be left behind. Richard thinks it would be a good idea to marry her after he gets rid of Anne."
Richard III,16,12,"Richard reasons that he's already killed a bunch of people, so what's a few more?"
Richard III,16,13,"Richard then meets with Tyrrell, who runs off to kill the young princes."
Richard III,16,14,Buckingham reminds Richard that he promised to give him the earldom of Hereford for his loyal service.
Richard III,16,15,Richard ignores him.
Richard III,16,16,"Richard warns Derby that if Derby's wife (mother to Richmond) sends any letters to Richmond, Derby will pay for it."
Richard III,16,17,Richard's mind is already moving to what's ahead (which seems like war with Richmond).
Richard III,16,18,"Richard then talks about King Henry VI, who prophesied long ago that Richmond would one day be King of England. Richard notes that Henry must have been mistaken in leaving out the part of the prophecy where he, King Richard III, kills Richmond."
Richard III,16,19,Richard recalls another prophecy warning him to fear Richmond.
Richard III,16,20,"Richard finally stops being distracted enough to tell Buckingham to leave him alone, as Buckingham has been whining on the sidelines this whole time."
Richard III,16,21,"Buckingham realizes that for all his evil deeds, he's being repaid just like the other men Richard turned on. Before he ends up like Hastings, Buckingham decides to flee to Brecknock, a mansion in Wales."
Richard III,23,0,"As Richard is throwing around his weight, Richmond enters the scene on another part of the stage. (This is a theatrical device for indicating two faraway places – in this case, the two rival camps.)"
Richard III,23,1,"Richmond is also making battle preparations, but rather than rely on the weakness of his enemy (as Richard does), he constructs a careful battle plan. He calls for pen and ink so he can draft all the battle movements and asks that some of his men stay to advise him."
Richard III,23,2,"Also in contrast to Richard, Richmond distributes the command among several leaders of regiments."
Richard III,23,3,Richmond's even having one of the earls come to visit him at 2am to talk shop and go over the plan.
Richard III,23,4,"Finally, Richmond asks Captain Blunt to find his stepfather Lord Stanley, who is half a mile from Richard's own camp and still pretending to be on Richard's side. Richmond gives Blunt a letter to deliver to Stanley before steeping himself in the battle plans and preparations."
Richard III,22,0,"Richard and his followers are at Bosworth Field in Leicester. He gets his men to pitch their tents, but he notes that they seem to be looking a bit unhappy."
Richard III,22,1,"Nonetheless, Richard seems unshakable in his optimism, especially since he's learned that Richmond has only six or seven thousand troops, a third of Richard's own forces. Besides the numbers, Richard is confident he'll win because he's the king."
Richard III,22,2,"Important note: In some editions of the play, this scene continues. In the edition we're working with (The Norton Shakespeare, second edition, published in 2008), Act 5, Scene 3 ends here and the action is picked up in Act 5, Scene 4."
Richard III,5,0,"In another room at the Palace, the old Duchess of York, (mother to King Edward IV, Richard of Gloucester, and George of Clarence) is spending quality time with Clarence's two kids, Margaret Plantagenet (not to be confused with Queen Margaret) and Edward Plantagenet (not to be confused King Edward or Prince Edward)."
Richard III,5,1,"The kids open the scene by asking if their father is dead. Their grandma says no, but they wonder why she's crying and calling them orphans and basically talking about their dead dad."
Richard III,5,2,"The kids conclude that their father is dead, and that the blame for it belongs to their uncle, King Edward. The boy is certain of this because his Uncle Richard told him so."
Richard III,5,3,"Just as their grandma is pointing out that their Uncle Richard is not trustworthy, Queen Elizabeth comes in, looking a mess and grieving for the dead King Edward."
Richard III,5,4,"Then everyone has a round of mourning over all the dead men in the family: Elizabeth has lost a husband, the children have lost a father, and the Duchess has lost two sons."
Richard III,5,5,"Just then Dorset and Rivers (who came in with the queen) interrupt with more pressing matters. The dead are dead, and the living must be crowned. Rivers suggests that Queen Elizabeth should straightaway send for her young son, also named Edward, who's next in line for the throne."
Richard III,5,6,"Just then Richard enters with Buckingham; Stanley, Earl of Derby; Hastings; and Ratcliffe."
Richard III,5,7,"Richard receives a cool welcome from his mother, and he and his lackeys discuss the transport of the young Edward to the throne from his place in Ludlow."
Richard III,5,8,Richard then dismisses the ladies to go think over who should bring the young king to the palace.
Richard III,5,9,"Once Richard and Buckingham have the room to themselves, Buckingham refers to some secret conference the two men had earlier. Buckingham agrees that regardless of who goes to fetch the young king, he and Richard should be there. Their presence will help their other plan, which is making sure that the queen's friends don't get close to the new king."
Richard III,5,10,Richard praises Buckingham for being so loyal.
Richard III,4,0,"At the palace in London, the sickly King Edward IV is gathered with Queen Elizabeth, her two sons Dorset and Gray, her brother Rivers, and Hastings, Catesby, and Buckingham (who have been fighting with Elizabeth's family)."
Richard III,4,1,"Edward warmly addresses the crowd and says something like ""Can't we all just get along?"""
Richard III,4,2,The two factions agree to play nice and ask God to punish them if they ever break this new bond.
Richard III,4,3,Richard enters and makes a big speech about how he too is committed to peace and how sorry he is for anything bad he might have done.
Richard III,4,4,The happy glow doesn't last long. Queen Elizabeth asks Edward to accept his imprisoned brother Clarence back into his good graces.
Richard III,4,5,"Richard acts like Elizabeth is cruelly and purposefully mocking – after all, don't they know about Clarence? (He knows they don't.) Richard then announces to the group that Clarence is dead, pretending to be shocked they haven't heard."
Richard III,4,6,"Everyone is shocked, especially King Edward, who knows he gave orders to reverse Clarence's sentence."
Richard III,4,7,"Richard is all, ""Oh dear, I guess your message got lost in the mail."""
Richard III,4,8,"Stanley, Earl of Derby, arrives and kneels before the king, asking him to pardon the life of a servant of his who killed a ""riotous gentleman"" earlier that day."
Richard III,4,9,"This really sets Edward off, and he begins to blame everyone around him for not stopping him from ordering Clarence's execution."
Richard III,4,10,"Edward then gives some examples of Clarence's goodness – from murdering Prince Edward of Wales for Edward's sake, to even giving up his cloak on a freezing night in battle, running around naked so Edward could be less naked."
Richard III,4,11,"Edward, after this tender reminiscing, pardons Derby's man, lamenting that had he been more forgiving earlier (like this), he might have saved his own brother."
Richard III,4,12,"Edward voices his fear that God will have justice on Clarence's behalf, judging everyone who didn't stand up for the condemned man."
Richard III,4,13,"The sickly king must then be carried off, leaving Richard behind with Buckingham, among others."
Richard III,4,14,"Richard, still crafty, quickly raises suspicions against the queen and her family. He notes how they looked pale on hearing of Clarence's death (like everyone did) and declares this is evidence that the queen encouraged the king to have Clarence killed."
Richard III,4,15,So much for the peace treaty.
Richard III,27,0,Richard and Richmond are onstage together in a fierce battle.
Richard III,27,1,Richmond slays Richard.
Richard III,27,2,"Now it's time for speeches, and the counting of the dead. George Stanley still lives, and they go over notable soldiers who have died on each side."
Richard III,27,3,Stanley plucks the crown from Richard's bleeding corpse and puts it on Richmond's head.
Richard III,27,4,"Richmond asks that everyone be buried according to his stature, and that repentant soldiers on Richard's side be forgiven."
Richard III,27,5,"Finally he turns to talk of his impending marriage with Elizabeth, daughter of Queen Elizabeth and the deceased King Edward IV. As Richmond comes from the Lancastrian line, and Elizabeth is a York, their union will finally bring the red and white roses together, ending the very long Wars of the Roses."
Richard III,27,6,Richmond happily declares that the time of division in England is over. He hopes they'll rule a unified and happy England under a lasting and unchallenged peace.
Richard III,26,0,"On the battlefield, Catesby calls out to Norfolk for help, as Richard seems to have taken to the battlefield in mad desperation."
Richard III,26,1,"Richard's horse has been killed, and Richard is wandering the battlefield on foot, killing everything in his path with a fatalistic fury."
Richard III,26,2,"Richard yells out the famous line, ""A horse, a horse! My kingdom for a horse!"""
Richard III,26,3,"Richard is mad with bloodlust. He says he's slain five of the six ""Richmonds"" on the field, but not the Richmond he wants. (It was common practice to dress a few guys up as the leader of the troops to distract and serve as decoys. Swell job, huh?)"
Richard III,26,4,"Richard runs off again, looking for horses and Richmond."
Richard III,1,0,"A coffin holding King Henry VI's corpse is being carried through the streets by a group of pallbearers. Henry's grieving daughter-in-law, Lady Anne, follows."
Richard III,1,1,Lady Anne orders the pallbearers to stop and take a break so she can deliver a big speech about how sad she is.
Richard III,1,2,"Anne curses the man responsible for murdering her husband and father-in-law and says she hopes the guy's future children will be deformed and that his future wife will be miserable. (Uh oh. Every student of history knows that Richard gets his way and marries Anne, so, she's basically just cursed herself. Check out ""Symbolism, Imagery, Allegory"" for more on this.)"
Richard III,1,3,"Richard strolls up to Anne and orders the pallbearers to scram, or else."
Richard III,1,4,"Anne calls Richard a ""minister of hell"" and some other not-so-nice names."
Richard III,1,5,"Anne points out that Henry VI's corpse is bleeding. (In Shakespeare's day, it was thought that a murdered man's wounds would bleed in the presence of his murderer.)"
Richard III,1,6,Then Richard does the unthinkable: he begins to put the moves on Anne...right in front of her father-in-law's bleeding corpse!
Richard III,1,7,"At first Anne resists but, before we know it, Richard has convinced her to accept his ring, and the two are going steady. Here's the quick and dirty version of how it all goes down:"
Richard III,1,8,Anne: You're disgusting. I hate you.
Richard III,1,9,Richard: You're hot when you're angry.
Richard III,1,10,Anne: You killed my husband and my father-in-law.
Richard III,1,11,"Richard: I didn't kill your husband, but I might have killed King Henry, who should probably thank me for sending him to heaven."
Richard III,1,12,Anne: I hate you.
Richard III,1,13,"Richard: I plan to take you to bed and ""lie with you."" By the way, your husband and King Henry are dead because I'm so in love with you."
Richard III,1,14,Anne: I hope you die.
Richard III,1,15,"Richard: I think we should get married, and, come to think of it, I probably did kill your husband."
Richard III,1,16,[Anne spits on Richard.]
Richard III,1,17,Richard: Sweet poison! I love it when you spit on me.
Richard III,1,18,Anne: Looking at you makes me sick.
Richard III,1,19,Richard: I love it when you look at me with those beautiful eyes.
Richard III,1,20,...
Richard III,1,21,"Richard: Your luscious lips were made ""for kissing."""
Richard III,1,22,...
Richard III,1,23,"Richard: Fine. If you hate me so much, why don't you just take my sword and stab me through the heart?"
Richard III,1,24,"Anne: I wish you were dead, but I'm not going to be the one to kill you."
Richard III,1,25,Richard: OK. Tell me to kill myself and I'll totally do it.
Richard III,1,26,Anne: No.
Richard III,1,27,Richard: I swear I'll kill myself...if that's what you really want.
Richard III,1,28,"Anne: ""I wish I knew thy heart."" Translation: ""I've just spent the last three minutes telling you why you're so revolting, but I'm going to let myself think that you might actually love me."""
Richard III,1,29,Richard: I think you should wear my ring.
Richard III,1,30,"Anne: OK, but that doesn't mean I love you or anything."
Richard III,1,31,"Psst. If you love Shakespeare on film as much as we do, you might want to check out how this scene was adapted in the 1995 film Richard III, which sets the play in 1930s London and features Richard (Ian McKellen) wooing Lady Anne (Kristen Scott Thomas)...in a morgue. Or if you're a traditionalist, check out how the oh-so-dreamy actor Laurence Olivier does it in the 1955 film adaptation."
Richard III,1,32,"Now that he's got Lady Anne under his thumb, Richard convinces her to abandon the funeral procession and go to Richard's bachelor pad (Crosby House)."
Richard III,1,33,He promises he'll get Henry's corpse to Chertsey monastery to have the body buried. He'll even spend some time weeping and repenting his evil deeds.
Richard III,1,34,"Anne is skeptical, but she leaves for Crosby House, stoked about Richard's apparent turnaround."
Richard III,1,35,"As soon as she leaves, Richard gleefully instructs the pallbearers to take Henry's body to White-friars (not where it's supposed to go)."
Richard III,1,36,"Richard asks the audience, ""Was ever woman in this humour wooed? / Was ever woman in this humour won?"" (Translation: ""Can you guys believe how smooth I am? I can hardly believe it myself!"")"
Richard III,1,37,"Richard jokes that even though he knows he's ugly, Anne must think he's pretty hot, so he better go out and buy new clothes and a fancy mirror."
Richard III,1,38,"First, though, he'll toss Henry's corpse into the ground and go back to Anne with all the appearances of mourning."
Richard III,1,39,"Richard also informs us that, though he's ecstatic over winning Anne, he doesn't intend to keep her as his wife very long."
Richard III,0,0,"Welcome to the streets of London, where Richard, Duke of Gloucester (the future King Richard III) delivers a famous soliloquy. (Psst: a soliloquy is just a speech that reveals a character's innermost thoughts to the audience.)"
Richard III,0,1,"Richard announces that civil war is over and that his big brother, King Edward IV, is chillin' on the English throne."
Richard III,0,2,"Since war has given way to peace, everyone is London is celebrating by partying and hooking up."
Richard III,0,3,Richard is not happy about this.
Richard III,0,4,"He claims he's not fit for peacetime because he was born prematurely and is a ""deformed"" hunchback who has no game with the ladies. (Also, dogs bark at him every time he limps along the streets, which puts him in a seriously bad mood.)"
Richard III,0,5,"Brain Snack: The historical Richard III wasn't actually a hunchback. This was just one of many nasty rumors started by historians (like Sir Thomas More) who wanted to make him look bad while making King Henry VII (a.k.a. Richmond, the guy who eventually bumped Richard off the throne) look good. Go to ""Symbolism, Imagery, Allegory"" and read about the ""Tudor myth"" for more about this."
Richard III,0,6,"Richard tells us that, since he ""cannot prove a lover,"" he'd rather spend his time being a ""villain."" (Translation: Richard wants to be king and he'll do anything to get the crown.)"
Richard III,0,7,"As it turns out, Richard has been a very busy boy: he's been plotting and scheming against everyone at court, including his own family members."
Richard III,0,8,"Richard tells us that a prophecy has been circulating around the kingdom: apparently, someone whose name is associated with the letter ""G"" is going to murder King Edward IV's heirs."
Richard III,0,9,"Richard is hoping that King Edward will think the ""G"" stands for their brother, *G*eorge, the Duke of Clarence. (In the play, he's simply called ""Clarence."")"
Richard III,0,10,"Who should show up at this moment but George (a.k.a. Clarence), surrounded by guards who are taking him to be imprisoned in the Tower of London."
Richard III,0,11,"Richard pretends to be shocked and appalled and says something like ""Hey Clarence, why are you being carted off to the slammer?"""
Richard III,0,12,"Clarence explains that King Edward suspects him of plotting against his kids because his first name starts with a ""G."""
Richard III,0,13,"Richard is all, ""Dang, that's horrible."" He then declares that this is all ""Lady Gray's"" (a.k.a. Queen Elizabeth's) fault because she hates Clarence and she's been badmouthing him to her husband, the king."
Richard III,0,14,"(Note: Richard calls King Edward's wife, Queen Elizabeth, ""Lady Gray"" because the queen was the widow of her first husband, Sir John Gray, before she married the king. Calling her ""Lady Gray"" is meant to be an insult. Also, Queen Elizabeth/Lady Gray is NOT the same Queen Elizabeth (1503-1603) who ruled England when Shakespeare wrote this play.)"
Richard III,0,15,"Richard claims that Lady Gray/Queen Elizabeth and her no-good brother were behind Lord Hastings' recent imprisonment, too. Luckily Hastings is getting out of jail today. But as long as the queen is manipulating the king, nobody's safe."
Richard III,0,16,"In fact, says Richard, the only reason Hastings is getting out of the slammer is because he's super friendly (if you know what we mean) with King Edward's mistress, Jane Shore. According to Richard, Jane Shore has the king totally whipped, so maybe everyone should kiss up to her if they want to stay in the king's good graces."
Richard III,0,17,"Richard's gossiping is broken up by Clarence's guard, Brackenbury, who'd really like to get Clarence to prison kind of soon. Brackenbury points out that he's just trying to do his job."
Richard III,0,18,"Before Clarence is led to the Tower, Richard promises to do his best to help him and says he's appalled by the way his brother is treating Clarence."
Richard III,0,19,"Once Clarence is gone, Richard tells us that he loves his brother so much that he'd like to send him on an all-expenses-paid trip to heaven – and who doesn't want to go to heaven?"
Richard III,0,20,"Richard's evil-genius ramblings are interrupted by Hastings, the guy who just got out of jail."
Richard III,0,21,Hastings says King Edward is sick – practically at death's door.
Richard III,0,22,"Hastings goes off to see the ailing King, and Richard promises to follow later."
Richard III,0,23,"Richard continues to hatch his evil plans (out loud, for our benefit). He'll visit King Edward, but only to encourage him in his hatred of Clarence. Richard hopes the king will have Clarence executed and then die soon after, which will leave Richard that much closer to the throne."
Richard III,0,24,"To add a new level to his scheming, Richard says he wants to marry Lady Anne Neville, even though he recently killed her husband and her father-in-law (King Henry VI)."
Richard III,0,25,"Richard thinks it will be fun to play mind games with a grieving widow and points out that marrying Anne is also strategic move for him, since she's from an important family and has ties to the late king."
Richard III,0,26,"Still, he's not going to call the wedding planner just yet, as he has to orchestrate his brothers' deaths first."
Richard III,19,0,"At Lord Stanley's house in London, Stanley has a secret meeting with a priest on Richmond's side."
Richard III,19,1,"Stanley laments that he can't openly fight on Richmond's side, because then Richard would kill his son, George Stanley, whom Richard insists on holding captive."
Richard III,19,2,"However, Stanley asks Urswick to send his regards to Richmond and to carry the news from Queen Elizabeth that she would very happily marry her little daughter Elizabeth to Richmond."
Richard III,19,3,It looks like Richard wasn't as successful as he thought at wooing the young girl through her mother.
Richard III,19,4,"Urswick in turn reports that Richmond is currently in Wales, and he's gathering support from a long list of VIPs. They're all heading towards London to take back the crown and to crush anyone who stands in their way."
Richard III,18,0,"Back in front of the palace, Queen Margaret is doing her usual bitter, creepy lurking-in-the-shadows act."
Richard III,18,1,"She says she's happy to witness the tragic downfall of this whole lot of people, and she'll be on her way to France before long."
Richard III,18,2,The Duchess of York and Queen Elizabeth jointly mourn the loss of the two princes and bemoan the state of the world in general.
Richard III,18,3,"Queen Margaret then comes forward and asks to join in this dark session, as she feels she has more to grieve over than either of the other ladies."
Richard III,18,4,"The women compare all the wrongs their men have done to each other, and Margaret blames the Duchess's son (Richard) for having a hand in the death of her husband (Prince Henry VI) and son (Prince Edward of Wales at Tewksbury). Queen Margaret also blames Richard for having a hand in killing little Prince Edward (Elizabeth's son in the tower) and even his own father, Richard Duke of York."
Richard III,18,5,"The Duchess points out that, actually, Margaret was mostly responsible for Richard Duke of York's death, and Margaret happily helped the murder of her young son Rutland."
Richard III,18,6,Finally Margaret settles on the fact that Richard killed his own brother Clarence (or at least ordered it) as evidence that the Duchess of York really does have the more vile offspring.
Richard III,18,7,Then Margaret calls the Duchess's womb a kennel that bore a hell-hound.
Richard III,18,8,"Queen Margaret then turns her bitterness from the Duchess onto Queen Elizabeth, who likely feels bad enough already, with her fair share of dead kids. Margaret happily reiterates her curse: Elizabeth wrongfully took what Margaret thought was hers (the queen's crown) and now Elizabeth has lost everything."
Richard III,18,9,Elizabeth asks Margaret to teach her how to curse (since Margaret's curses are obviously so effective).
Richard III,18,10,"Margaret says that if you concentrate on your own unhappiness, you can magnify it, which makes for good cursing. Basically, Elizabeth just needs to act like Margaret and feed a black and icy heart, which will only get blacker and icier if you do the whole thing right."
Richard III,18,11,Then Margaret goes off to France.
Richard III,18,12,"The Duchess has a bright idea: she'd like Elizabeth to help her smother her son King Richard. With bad words, we mean."
Richard III,18,13,"Richard enters with his royal train and is immediately seized upon by his mother, the Duchess of York, who says she wishes she had strangled him in her womb."
Richard III,18,14,"Queen Elizabeth joins in, and both women begin to rail on Richard, listing all the people he's wrongfully murdered."
Richard III,18,15,"Richard responds in something of a panic. He says that as the ""Lord's anointed"" he doesn't need to hear the shrill cries of these women. To drown them out, he demands that his people strike up loud music."
Richard III,18,16,"The women are undeterred, though, and the Duchess of York insists on having a word with Richard. Her essential claim amounts to the fact that since his birth, Richard has only ever been a burden to her."
Richard III,18,17,"The Duchess promises she will never speak to Richard again, but she says she hopes God will kill him on the battlefield."
Richard III,18,18,"Before she exits, she says she will pray for his enemies, and wishes him a bloody and shameful death (soon!)."
Richard III,18,19,Richard recovers surprisingly quickly from his mother's death wish.
Richard III,18,20,"He immediately takes Queen Elizabeth aside and says he wants to marry her daughter. (Yep, his niece.)"
Richard III,18,21,Queen Elizabeth is horrified.
Richard III,18,22,Richard denies that he had anything to do with murdering her sons in the Tower.
Richard III,18,23,Richard asks Queen Elizabeth for some tips on how to woo little Elizabeth.
Richard III,18,24,"Queen Elizabeth suggests that Richard carve the name of her two dead sons, Edward and York, into their tiny bleeding hearts and send that along to the little sister."
Richard III,18,25,Elizabeth reminds everyone of the time when Queen Margaret gave Richard's dad a handkerchief steeped in his own son's blood. Maybe Richard has a similar handkerchief he could give Elizabeth with her brothers' blood?
Richard III,18,26,"If that gift idea doesn't do it, Richard could write a letter detailing all the people he's murdered, and especially emphasize that he had Anne murdered just so he could marry little Elizabeth."
Richard III,18,27,"Richard points out that things would be fair and square between them if he married little Elizabeth. He may have stolen the kingdom from the princes by killing them, but he could keep it in the family by marrying their sister."
Richard III,18,28,"Also, this alliance is the best way to stop a civil war – it could forge a nifty alliance."
Richard III,18,29,"Richard continues to argue audaciously on his own behalf, and the queen meets him with sharp retorts. She declares that nothing Richard can say will make her believe him. By breaking the peace made by the dying King Edward IV, and by murdering his rightful heirs, it's clear Richard can't be trusted."
Richard III,18,30,"Richard, it seems, is a bit cowed. He makes a vow of his own that (as with all the prophecies in the play) will come back to bite him in the tuchus. Richard vows to never have happiness or good luck if he doesn't value little Elizabeth with ""immaculate devotion and holy thoughts."" (Since we've never known Richard to have either of those things, looks like it's goodbye happiness and good luck.)"
Richard III,18,31,Richard reiterates he'd like Queen Elizabeth to be his advocate in making his case to little Elizabeth.
Richard III,18,32,"Richard stresses that Queen Elizabeth should think not on who he has been, but on who he'll grow to be."
Richard III,18,33,"Finally, after what seems like ages of talking, Queen Elizabeth says she'll talk to her daughter on Richard's behalf."
Richard III,18,34,"Queen Elizabeth relents her anti-Richard position, and no sooner is she out the door than Richard dismisses her gleefully as a ""shallow, changing woman!"""
Richard III,18,35,"Just then, Richard begins receiving reports that Richmond has taken to the seas, and he's expecting the aid of Buckingham. Further, the people who are on Richard's side are clearly half-hearted and are doing very little to beat the enemy army back."
Richard III,18,36,Richard loses composure when Lord Stanley arrives with the news that Richmond has shown up to seize the throne of England.
Richard III,18,37,Richard then lashes out against Stanley. He questions why Stanley came without troops and wonders whether Stanley's troops are helping the enemy to shore.
Richard III,18,38,"Stanley promises he wouldn't betray Richard, but Richard knows betrayal like the back of his hand, so he covers himself. He says Stanley can go gather troops, but he must leave his son, George Stanley, in Richard's care. If the troops Stanley brings aren't for Richard's side, then Stanley's son will lose his head."
Richard III,18,39,"As Stanley exits, Richard learns that more of his friends are defecting to Richmond's side and mounting armies."
Richard III,18,40,"By the time a third messenger shows up, Richard has flown into a passionate rage. He smacks the poor guy around a little before he hears the good news that Buckingham's army has been scattered by flooding, and Buckingham has wandered off to god knows where."
Richard III,18,41,Richard then hears from another messenger that the army from Brittany is definitely dispersed.
Richard III,18,42,"With this news that the enemy army is also a bit disoriented, Richard seems to take heart and prepares to head for the battlefield. Things are in such a state of disarray that he's feeling bloodlust-y regardless of whether he's fighting foreign enemies or domestic rebels. Seriously, he's just ready to go kill some people."
Richard III,18,43,"Richard then receives news from Catesby that Buckingham is caught, but Richmond now leads a mighty fighting force."
Richard III,18,44,Richard says he's done talking – he wants the captive Buckingham taken to Salisbury.
Richard III,13,0,"On a street in London, a scrivener (a guy who copies documents for a living) enters, holding the indictment of Lord Hastings that's to be read to the people of London that day (even though Hastings is already dead)."
Richard III,13,1,"The scrivener points out that Catesby gave him a rough draft of the indictment the night before, well before Hastings was even imprisoned or executed. (Clearly the plan to kill Hastings was afoot long before the man had even done anything wrong.)"
Richard III,13,2,"The scrivener is disgusted by the obviousness of the devious plot and says that nobody is brave enough to speak out against the government's corruption. He bemoans the state of the world, when men must stand by while evil reigns unchecked."
Richard III,12,0,"At the Tower of London, Richard makes Buckingham promise that he'll do whatever Richard says."
Richard III,12,1,"Catesby enters with the mayor of London. Richard and Buckingham make a great show of declaring their vigilance, saying they're trying to protect themselves (and the mayor) from some impending great danger."
Richard III,12,2,Lovel and Ratcliffe enter with Hastings' head.
Richard III,12,3,"When Richard and Buckingham see Hastings's head, they pretend to be sad that Hastings turned out to be a traitor who plotted against their lives."
Richard III,12,4,The lord mayor is convinced that Hastings deserved to be executed without a trial.
Richard III,12,5,Richard says he wishes the mayor were there to hear Hastings's confession so he could tell the commoners what happened. Richard's afraid the citizens of London will be unhappy and blame him.
Richard III,12,6,The mayor runs off to assure the citizens that Hastings's death was actually a rightful and just execution by the state.
Richard III,12,7,"After the mayor exits on his errand, Richard reveals the plan he's hatched to gain the crown: he wants Buckingham to go to Guildhall (the seat of municipal government in London) and spread a rumor that King Edward's sons are ""bastard[s]"" and therefore not the rightful heirs to the crown."
Richard III,12,8,Buckingham should tell people that King Edward slept around a lot and that he once executed a citizen for no good reason.
Richard III,12,9,"Buckingham should also say that Edward's mom (who is also Richard's mom) had affairs while her husband was off fighting the French and that Edward is ""illegitimate."" This would make his kids illegitimate, too, and unfit to be crowned kings."
Richard III,12,10,"Richard decides that Buckingham should only hint that Edward was illegitimate. After all, his mom is still alive, and you don't want to shout too loud about your mom's infidelity."
Richard III,12,11,Buckingham exits.
Richard III,12,12,Richard says he's going to hide Clarence's kids and make sure nobody has access to the princes (Edward's children).
Richard III,20,0,Buckingham has been captured and forcefully taken to Salisbury. His requests to speak with Richard have been denied.
Richard III,20,1,"Knowing he's been absolutely forsaken by the wicked king, Buckingham notes that today is All Souls' Day, the day set aside to commemorate (and in some cases exonerate) the dead. It's fitting, he thinks, for the souls of all those whose lives have been wrongfully taken by Richard to watch over the king's demise, hopefully taking pleasure in it."
Richard III,20,2,"Buckingham begins to take stock of his life: he betrayed King Edward by being unfaithful to Edward's children and Queen Elizabeth's allies, and he realizes he was foolish to trust Richard, who would never trust him (or anyone). He admits he's been a wicked man, and he can see God's justice in having his wickedness be his own downfall."
Richard III,20,3,"Finally, like so many others, he thinks on Queen Margaret's curse. She condemned him to have his heart split open with sorrow caused by Richard, and she was mostly right."
Richard III,20,4,"Buckingham then tells his guards to lead him ""to the block of shame"" for his beheading in the marketplace."
Richard III,21,0,"Richmond has made camp at Tamworth, only a day's march from where Richard is encamped at Leicester."
Richard III,21,1,"As Richmond and his men have been marching across England to face Richard, he has been receiving encouraging and informative letters about Richard's placement and army strength from his stepfather Stanley, who is still in Richard's fold."
Richard III,21,2,Richmond gives a rousing and beautiful speech to his followers about the damage that Richard has caused to England and to each individual citizen. Richmond hails this battle as the final bloody push to bring a lasting peace to the land.
Richard III,21,3,"His men believe that conscience is on their side, which makes up for any numbers they might lack. One man fighting for his convictions is as good as a thousand men."
Richard III,21,4,"Also, Richard's forces are waning in number: those who fight beside him do so out of fear more than love. This can't bode well for Richard on the field, as his men will likely desert as soon as they're given the chance."
Richard III,21,5,"Richmond, with a final note that his men fight on the side of true hope, inspires his men to march on to battle."
Richard III,6,0,"Three citizens meet on a street in London, chatting about the latest news. They wonder what the heck is going to happen to England now that King Edward IV is dead."
Richard III,6,1,"One is optimistic that Edward's son will reign, and though the boy is still too young to do the job properly, at the very least he'll be surrounded by good counsel, which will lead England wisely until the boy is old enough to take over."
Richard III,6,2,"Another citizen is less confident about the nation's safety, especially since there are two factions competing to advise the young king. On the one side is Richard of Gloucester, who is dangerous. On the other side is Queen Elizabeth's family, who are a bunch of snobs."
Richard III,6,3,"Regardless of who triumphs, the citizens are sure of one thing: there's bound to be a whole lot of drama before the next king is crowned."
Richard III,7,0,"At the palace in London, Queen Elizabeth chills out with the Duchess of York, the cardinal, and her young son, the Duke of York."
Richard III,7,1,Everyone's excited and a little worried about little Prince Edward making it to the castle OK – who knows what could happen to him before he can be crowned King?
Richard III,7,2,"Prince Edward's little brother, the Duke of York, jokes around with the adults and shows that he's a pretty sharp little kid. He tells his mom and grandmother that his Uncle Richard used to bag on him and tease him about growing like a weed."
Richard III,7,3,The Duchess of York points out that Richard wasn't exactly a healthy child – he grew pretty slowly when he was young.
Richard III,7,4,The little Duke of York says he heard that his Uncle Richard was born with teeth and Queen Elizabeth tells him to quit being a little brat – it's not nice to gossip about adults.
Richard III,7,5,"A messenger arrives with bad news: Lord Rivers, Lord Gray, and Sir Thomas Vaughn have been thrown in the slammer at Pomfret Castle. (Pomfret is the castle where King Richard II died.)"
Richard III,7,6,Everyone knows this is bad news. Imprisonment there is usually just one step away from execution.
Richard III,7,7,Guess who gave the orders for the arrests? Richard (Duke of Gloucester) and Buckingham.
Richard III,7,8,Elizabeth freaks out and predicts that her entire family is going down.
Richard III,7,9,"The Duchess of York points out how terrible civil war is, especially when family members are willing to kill each other."
Richard III,7,10,"Elizabeth decides to take her youngest son, the Duke of York, and escape to sanctuary with him. She is given blessings and a seal from the Cardinal, who will lead her to safety."
Richard III,14,0,Richard and Buckingham meet at Baynard's Castle.
Richard III,14,1,Buckingham reports that the citizens weren't very excited about the big speech he made about why Richard should be crowned king. Nor were they buying his story about King Edward being illegitimate.
Richard III,14,2,"Buckingham was a bit unnerved by this lack of enthusiasm for Richard's coronation, so he had the mayor speak to the people on his behalf. Rather than saying that he personally backed Richard, the mayor basically just kept repeating, ""What Buckingham is saying is..."""
Richard III,14,3,"Not surprisingly, the people still weren't into it. Finally, though, about ten people in the back threw their hats in the air in praise of ""King Richard."""
Richard III,14,4,Buckingham seized the moment and declared he had heard the will of the people: they all loved Richard. Then he ran out of there before anyone could argue with him.
Richard III,14,5,"Richard is not pleased with the public's lackluster response, so he and Buckingham hatch yet another plan to get Richard onto the throne. Basically, they'll convince the mayor to speak to the people on Richard's behalf. Buckingham will tell the mayor that he had to beg Richard to be king – that Richard doesn't want to be king but might accept the crown if it's the will of the people."
Richard III,14,6,"Richard, meanwhile, has sequestered himself with holy men and prayer books. He's supposed to look like he's been earnestly praying over the issue (the more to set him apart as a holy man, compared to Edward's now-bad reputation)."
Richard III,14,7,"When Richard finally meets with the mayor and the assembled noblemen, Buckingham makes a dramatic (and deceitful) speech to Richard in front of everyone. Buckingham basically makes it sound like Richard would be committing treason if he didn't accept the crown, as he'd be turning over England's leadership to the children of a bastard."
Richard III,14,8,"Richard then makes a big show of waffling, as though he was really hesitant to accept the crown. He talks about how unworthy he is and really lays it on thick."
Richard III,14,9,"Buckingham says that he can see that Richard loves the young Edward too much to depose him, but he says the people will never stand for England being ruled by a bastard child."
Richard III,14,10,"Buckingham then throws out an ultimatum: either Richard takes the throne or the throne will be left to young Edward, who will be promptly unseated by the people, meaning the York line will lose the throne all together. Having thrown this out there, Buckingham leaves in an apparent huff."
Richard III,14,11,"Richard, pretending he's very sad to upset anyone, finally relents and says fine, he'll take the crown, even though he doesn't really want to be a king. (Yeah right.)"
Richard III,14,12,"Buckingham hails Richard as King of England, and everyone says ""Amen."" It's decided that Richard should take the throne the very next day."
Richard III,14,13,"Richard keeps playing the innocent ""Aw, shucks, I guess I'll be king if you really want me to."" He quickly leaves with the Bishops to make a big show of how holy and pious and fit he is to be England's king."
Richard III,15,0,"The ladies of the court are gathered before the Tower of London. The old Duchess of York, Queen Elizabeth, and Lady Anne (leading Clarence's young daughter, Margaret Plantagenet) all greet each other joyfully. They're all going to visit the young princes in the Tower."
Richard III,15,1,"Lieutenant Brackenbury intercepts them with surprising news: visiting the princes is forbidden. They learn that this surprising order has actually come down from Richard, the ""Lord Protector,"" whom Brackenbury accidentally calls the king."
Richard III,15,2,"The women, who have not yet heard the news of wicked Richard snatching the throne, are all shocked and cry out that they hope it's not true. They can't believe Richard is the king and has the right to give orders. They're all willing to defy his order and suffer the consequences."
Richard III,15,3,"Then the ladies get the really bad news. Stanley Earl of Derby shows up and announces that an hour from now he can call two of the ladies queens (referring to Queen Elizabeth, wife of Edward IV, and now Queen Anne, wife of newly crowned Richard III)."
Richard III,15,4,"Upon hearing that Richard is to be king, Elizabeth and Anne are horrified, and the Duchess of York, Richard's mother, curses her own womb as a bed of death."
Richard III,15,5,"In the midst of her grief, Queen Elizabeth instructs her son Dorset to leave for Brittany immediately, where the Earl of Richmond (enemy of Edward IV and the Yorks) has been waiting out Edward's reign. Elizabeth fears that if Dorset stays, he will be the next of her children to fall victim to Richard."
Richard III,15,6,"Further, Elizabeth wails as she realizes she has become victim of old Queen Margaret's curse and that she would die neither a mother, a wife, nor a queen."
Richard III,15,7,"Stanley, Earl of Derby, who brought the news about Richard's coronation, is stepfather to Richmond, whose lineage puts him in the running for the crown. (We know, this is complicated.) Derby promises to send letters to Richmond to prepare his stepson to harbor whoever is fleeing England."
Richard III,15,8,"Anne, like Elizabeth, is horrified. She has to follow Richard's bidding and be his queen, but she wishes her royal crown were made of red-hot steel so it would burn out her brains. (This was an actual Renaissance punishment sometimes used on traitors. Gross.)"
Richard III,15,9,"Anne notes that she, like Elizabeth, is the victim of a prophetic curse."
Richard III,15,10,"Remember, back when Anne – still a fresh widow – followed Henry VI's corpse to be buried, she cursed Richard. She wished that whatever idiot married Richard would have a miserable life. Little did she know that she would be the woman to marry Richard – she cursed herself!"
Richard III,15,11,Anne admits she was foolishly moved by Richard's flattering words.
Richard III,15,12,"Also, Anne doesn't really sleep well because Richard's always keeping her up when he flails about from bad dreams."
Richard III,15,13,"Not to mention, Richard hated Anne's dad, Warwick, and Anne fears that Richard likely hates her too. Finally, Anne worries Richard will have her killed off soon."
Richard III,15,14,"Richard's mother, the Duchess of York, cuts off all the crying and instructs everyone: Dorset should go to Richmond's place, Anne must to go to Richard, and Elizabeth must take herself back to sanctuary."
Richard III,15,15,Then the Duchess abruptly declares she'd like to go to her grave. She says she's suffered some 80-odd years of misery and she's ready to be done.
Richard III,15,16,"To round out the melodrama of the ladies' scene, Elizabeth has everyone turn back dramatically to look at the forbidden tower and contemplate her poor little baby princes who are locked up there."
A Christmas Carol,2,0,"Scrooge snorts himself awake, and again it's about to be one o'clock. Scrooge is hip to all this now, though, so he doesn't freak out."
A Christmas Carol,2,1,"Instead, he decides to be proactive, so he pulls apart the bed curtains himself this time, and gets ready to not be shocked. Except… nothing happens."
A Christmas Carol,2,2,"Well, nothing happens until he sees a weird light coming from the next room and decides to investigate. Guess what? That's right. Ghost time."
A Christmas Carol,2,3,"The second ghost looks like a middle-aged frat boy after a party. He's only wearing a half-open bathrobe, has a drunkenly jolly vibe, and he's surrounded by a ton of food and drinks."
A Christmas Carol,2,4,"Oh, and he's holding a cornucopia in his hand. (Cool word alert, kids—cornucopia is the Latin word for ""horn of plenty"", and it literally means a hollow animal horn filled with whatever goodies you want. It has since come to have a more general, figurative meaning: an overabundant supply of something.)"
A Christmas Carol,2,5,This guy turns out to be the Ghost of Christmas Present.
A Christmas Carol,2,6,Scrooge grabs onto his bathrobe and away they go!
A Christmas Carol,2,7,"First on the menu is just a nice little flyover of the city, where everyone is bustling around getting ready for Christmas dinner. Friendly snowball fights, lots of food, neighbors getting together, and just an eerily picture-perfect scene all around."
A Christmas Carol,2,8,The cornucopia turns out to have magic pixie dust in it that spreads Christmas cheer wherever the middle-aged frat ghost dumps some of it out.
A Christmas Carol,2,9,"They float away from the town and on to the house of Bob Cratchit, Scrooge's clerk. Spoiler alert: Tiny Tim is coming, so grab the tissues and get ready for the tear-jerking."
A Christmas Carol,2,10,"The Cratchits are poor, but totally loving and adorable, of course. The mom loves the kids, the kids love the mom, the kids love each other, and everyone is just super hunky-dory."
A Christmas Carol,2,11,"They get the table ready for the meal, and then Bob comes home from church with their youngest, sickest kid, Tiny Tim, who is all shriveled up and also walks with a crutch."
A Christmas Carol,2,12,"Not only is Tiny Tim brave and stoic about his illness, but he also has deep thoughts about it—he tells his dad that he likes being a visual reminder for everyone else at church about how Christ healed the lame and made the blind see again. Wow, that's some high-level maturity perspective there, kiddo! Sure you aren't secretly a tiny seventy-year-old man?"
A Christmas Carol,2,13,"Their sad little dinner is served, and they all eat with gusto."
A Christmas Carol,2,14,"Scrooge is again really quick on the uptake and asks his frat man ghost whether Tiny Tim will live. Um, not so much, says the ghost… unless something changes in their lives! Hmm… wonder what needs to change?"
A Christmas Carol,2,15,"Then, Bob proposes a toast to his boss Scrooge. He seems to have a lot of compassion for how miserable and horrible Scrooge is, but Mrs. Cratchit, not so much. When the gloom of mentioning Scrooge's name in public wears off, they all get happy again and talk about how awesome it will be when the older kids get jobs and start to earn some money."
A Christmas Carol,2,16,"The ghost rubs Scrooge's nose in all of this just a little more, and then they float away to a mining field. It's horrible and desolate, but still, in a tiny hut, there is a little family celebrating Christmas."
A Christmas Carol,2,17,"Then they float even farther away to a lighthouse in the middle of nowhere. But of course, the two dudes inside are totally Christmasing it up."
A Christmas Carol,2,18,"And even all the way out in the middle of the ocean, on a boat, all the sailors are drinking and singing and getting into the holiday spirit."
A Christmas Carol,2,19,"Scrooge is all, huh."
A Christmas Carol,2,20,"And then, just like that, the final stop on the tour: Scrooge's nephew Fred's house."
A Christmas Carol,2,21,"Fred and his wife are having a party with some friends, and of course, they are totally talking about Scrooge right when he gets there. Weird how that keeps happening, right?"
A Christmas Carol,2,22,"Mostly, Fred and the gang are laughing about how Scrooge doesn't believe in Christmas. Fred says that he will continue to try to get his uncle to come over for the holiday every year forever."
A Christmas Carol,2,23,"They then start to play games, mostly blind-man's bluff. (Shmoop brain snack: this is basically blindfolded tag.)"
A Christmas Carol,2,24,"It's pretty funny, actually, because the dude who is ""it"" starts peeking around his blindfold to keep hugging the girl he's into at the party."
A Christmas Carol,2,25,Fun is had by all.
A Christmas Carol,2,26,"The last game is a variation of Twenty Questions, with Fred thinking of something, and the others eventually guessing that the ""growling and grunting animal"" is actually Scrooge. Okay, okay, we get it. Point made."
A Christmas Carol,2,27,"They drink to Scrooge's health, and with that, the ghost pulls Scrooge away from the scene."
A Christmas Carol,2,28,"They fly around a little bit more, seeing more of the same thing."
A Christmas Carol,2,29,"Finally, Scrooge notices that the middle-aged frat ghost is now more like an old man frat ghost. Turns out, it only gets to live until the end of Christmas."
A Christmas Carol,2,30,And now it's time for some totally freaky craziness.
A Christmas Carol,2,31,"Scrooge looks down and sees a huge claw coming out of the bottom of ghost's robe (and there is a totally great moment, in which, with awesome British politeness, Scrooge is like, ""excuse me please for being so forward, but is that perhaps some kind of monster coming out from under your clothing?"" as opposed to a more normal reaction which would probably be something like ""AAAAAH!"")."
A Christmas Carol,2,32,"The claw turns out to be… two small children! The elderly male Ghost of Christmas Present has just given birth to two small children! But we gloss right over to that, to reveal that these children are symbols—the boy is Ignorance, and the girl is Want (meaning poverty or the lack of something)."
A Christmas Carol,2,33,The ghost tells Scrooge that people need to watch out and not have these children running around in the world. Scrooge makes a note of that.
A Christmas Carol,2,34,"Just then, the jolly frat ghost disappears. Scrooge turns around, only to see… a scary phantom draped in a hooded cloak coming towards him."
A Christmas Carol,3,0,"The phantom doesn't talk, but just points out with its hand."
A Christmas Carol,3,1,"This is definitely really spooky, but instead of getting really terrified, Scrooge turns into that kid with his hand raised straining to get called on in class. He's all, ""You're the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come!"""
A Christmas Carol,3,2,"The thing doesn't answer. ""Ooh, ooh, you're about to show me the future!"" No answer. ""Oh, I know, I know, you're here to make me a better person, and I'm totally on board with that!"""
A Christmas Carol,3,3,"The phantom floats away, with Scrooge somehow dangling from its cloak."
A Christmas Carol,3,4,"Immediately they are in the city, overhearing a convo between a few business dudes. Seems like someone is dead that neither of them cares about, and they are kind of laughing about how hard it'll be to gather up people for the funeral."
A Christmas Carol,3,5,"Huh. Wonder who is dead. Scrooge certainly has no idea, and tries to get the phantom to cough up some info, but no dice."
A Christmas Carol,3,6,"Another couple of businessmen also seem to be talking about a dead guy, but they care even less than the first group."
A Christmas Carol,3,7,"Scrooge is all, well, none of this is relevant to my embetterment, so let's get on with the show already! Oh, Scroogey, Scroogey. How could you possibly not be catching on to this?"
A Christmas Carol,3,8,"The phantom takes him to the shady side of town, to a rag and bone merchant (basically a gross old pawn shop type place). Just as they show up, two women and a man come up to the counter with bags of stuff."
A Christmas Carol,3,9,The first is a charwoman.
A Christmas Carol,3,10,"Okay, here's a little Shmooptastic primer in ye olde Victorian house servants. So, since labor was super-cheap back in the day, most people could afford servants. This meant that basically almost everyone above the very, very dirt poor would have a bunch of different people doing stuff for them. There would at least be some housemaids for cleaning, some charwomen for heavy-duty cleaning, and some cooks for… um, cooking, obviously. Poorer people would still have to rely on servants—usually just a charwoman to come and help with the serious cleaning, which was hard, because, you know, no DJ Roomba or Oxy Clean and stuff. Anyway, it's pretty significant that although Scrooge is rolling in it, he has almost no one working for him except the charwoman. It's just one more way to show how tightfisted the dude is."
A Christmas Carol,3,11,"Right, back to the pawnshop. The charwoman is a little stressed to show all her stolen goods at first, but the pawn shop owner is like, hey that dead guy was horrible, so who cares that you stole all his stuff, amirite?"
A Christmas Carol,3,12,"This brilliant bit of philosophy does the trick, and the charwoman starts to unload the stuff… except the man pushes ahead of her and goes first. His plunder is mostly some office equipment."
A Christmas Carol,3,13,"Next is the second woman, who turns out to be a laundress. She's got sheets and towels and some clothes."
A Christmas Carol,3,14,"Finally, the charwoman's turn. She's got… yikes, she's got the bed curtains! And the bed blankets! And even the shirt that the dead guy was going to be buried in."
A Christmas Carol,3,15,"The moral of the story? No one cared enough to check on the dead guy, so these three ripped him off to their hearts' content."
A Christmas Carol,3,16,"Scrooge is all, man, that poor sucker! Good thing that's not me! He tells the phantom that he's totally learned his lesson, and he'll change his ways so he doesn't become that guy. Funny how he's suddenly really not so quick on the uptake, eh?"
A Christmas Carol,3,17,"The phantom is all, ugh, you are so slow. Okay then. Desperate times…"
A Christmas Carol,3,18,It takes Scrooge to see the dead body lying under a sheet in some dark room with no people around.
A Christmas Carol,3,19,"Scrooge again isn't making the connection, and is like, yes, yes, I get it, I will totally be better so I don't end up like whoever that random stranger is! Then for some reason, Scrooge asks the phantom if there is anyone who feels anything about this guy's death."
A Christmas Carol,3,20,"All right, everyone, get ready for a twist!"
A Christmas Carol,3,21,"The only people who feel anything about the death are a couple who feel… happiness! Oh, tricky word play, Dickens, you old so-and-so."
A Christmas Carol,3,22,"The reason these two are so happy is that they were in debt to the dead guy who was threatening them with bankruptcy, but now that he is dead they have some time to try to come up with the money."
A Christmas Carol,3,23,"Suddenly, Scrooge and the phantom are at the Cratchits' house. Nothing too happy is happening there. The kids all have to go out and get jobs. And also it turns out that Tiny Tim is dead. Bob Cratchit comes back from the cemetery and breaks down."
A Christmas Carol,3,24,"Scrooge is moved, but kind of wants to get out of there. We don't blame him."
A Christmas Carol,3,25,"He asks the phantom to finally show him himself in the future. Um. Yeah, folks, he still isn't catching on."
A Christmas Carol,3,26,"The phantom starts taking him somewhere, and they go by his old office. Scrooge peeks in only to see some other guy in his place. Huh, that's curious."
A Christmas Carol,3,27,"Finally, they get to an abandoned cemetery and the phantom points down at one of the graves. Scrooge totally freaks out, but still makes his way over to the grave and sees… his own name! Dun dun dun. Okay, yeah, we all saw it coming. Not too much suspense there."
A Christmas Carol,3,28,Scrooge suddenly clues in to the fact that the dead guy he saw on the bed and whom everyone was discussing was actually him.
A Christmas Carol,3,29,"In terror, he asks the phantom a pretty crucial question—whether what he is being shown is actually the future, or just one of a number of possible futures. Basically, old Scrooge has just stumbled on the multi-verse theory of quantum physics. Way to go!"
A Christmas Carol,3,30,"Scrooge grabs onto the phantom's hand, but the phantom shrinks away into a post."
A Christmas Carol,4,0,That post turns out to be… Scrooge's own bed post. He is back in his bed. And his bed curtains are still there. And he has time to fix his life.
A Christmas Carol,4,1,"Scrooge gets dressed and runs to the window, laughing for the first time in many years. He hears church bells, and a boy passing by tells him it's Christmas Day."
A Christmas Carol,4,2,"All smiles and compliments, Scrooge tells the boy to go buy the prize turkey from the poultry shop, planning to send it to the Cratchits. He pays for the boy's time, the turkey, and even cab fare for him to haul the thing out to their house."
A Christmas Carol,4,3,"Outside, Scrooge runs into those charity collectors from the day before. He gives them a huge pile of money and then goes off to church and to walk around looking at people. All of this makes him super-happy."
A Christmas Carol,4,4,"He decides to head over to his nephew's house, where he totally startles his niece-in-law, and where he has a blast at the Christmas party they've got going on (it's the one we saw earlier in the story)."
A Christmas Carol,4,5,"The next morning, he pretends to be all gruff and crabby at work, and then shocks Cratchit by giving him a huge raise and even buying some coal to heat the place for once."
A Christmas Carol,4,6,"And finally, we learn what the real future turns out to be. Scrooge helps out the Cratchit family, takes care of Tiny Tim (who then ends up surviving), and generally becomes a wonderful guy all around."
A Christmas Carol,4,7,Everyone for ever after says that he sure is really good at keeping up the spirit of Christmas.
A Christmas Carol,1,0,"Scrooge wakes up and starts freaking out because the clock makes it seem like he slept straight through the next day… but, you know, once you start messing around with ghosts and stuff, the clock is the least of your problems."
A Christmas Carol,1,1,"Scrooge goes over the whole thing with Marley in his head and decides it was probably a crazy dream. Which—um, spoiler alert—not really."
A Christmas Carol,1,2,"Suddenly, the clock strikes one, the curtains of his bed are pulled open, and he sees… a ghost that looks like a cross between a tiny old man and a child. (Oh, just a little Shmooptastic FYI here: back in the day, they had four-post beds for a reason—there were curtains going from post to post that you would pull closed to sleep. So those are the curtains that we're talking about here.)"
A Christmas Carol,1,3,"So. The kid/grandpa ghost is crazy looking, sometimes with twenty legs, sometimes with no head. It also is very, very bright, but carries with it a huge version of an old-timey metal candle-extinguisher (basically, a little cone-shaped thing that you would put over a candle to cut off the evaporated candle wax fumes that make the fire go in order to put it out)."
A Christmas Carol,1,4,"It claims to be the Ghost of Christmas Past, and takes Scrooge off for a walk through the wall. Scrooge is all, um, that's not going to fly for me, buddy, but the ghost magics him into being transmutable. Sweet."
A Christmas Carol,1,5,Off they go.
A Christmas Carol,1,6,"First stop? Scrooge's totally depressing childhood, spent all alone in a school where every other kid is off for Christmas break with the family."
A Christmas Carol,1,7,"(Before we go on, we have to point out something here. Scrooge starts to break down pretty much immediately from this point on. Like, there is almost no effort required on the part of the ghosts to get him to own up to being a jerk. Almost every modern adaptation of the whole Scrooge-and-the-three-ghosts archetype that follows this one—and there are many, so check out Shmoop's ""Best of the Web"" section for some cool ones—tries to draw out this process a bit more. So it's always a little shocking to re-read the original and see that Scrooge gives in to the lesson-learning with no resistance at all.)"
A Christmas Carol,1,8,Back to the story.
A Christmas Carol,1,9,"Scrooge starts to sob hysterically at the sight of himself as a little boy reading a bunch of fantasy books. (Oh, and did you notice that he reads pretty much only adventure stories? That's pretty at odds with his hyper-rational self in the present. Dickens, by the way, was way against rationalism.)"
A Christmas Carol,1,10,"Not only does he cry, but also he immediately fesses up to the kid/grandpa ghost that he should really have shelled out some coin to that caroling kid from earlier in the evening."
A Christmas Carol,1,11,"But it's time to get back on the love train, oops we mean the ghost train. Stop number two is another one of these Christmas-vacation-spent-at-school days. This time, though, Scrooge's little sister comes to bring him home. Her big news is that their dad has for some reason gotten way nicer and so little Ebenezer is allowed to come back home for good."
A Christmas Carol,1,12,"(Wait, what? Yeah, no kidding. None of this is filled in beyond what we're telling you here—why on earth he was sent away in the first place, what was the matter with crazy old dad, why the sister was allowed to stay behind, and what changed? Apparently doesn't matter when you're trying to crank this thing out to get it published before the Christmas deadline.)"
A Christmas Carol,1,13,"Anyway, we learn that the sister is dead now, but that Scrooge's nephew is her son. Which… doesn't really tell us anything that the word ""nephew"" didn't already convey, but, you know, clearly this is more important than the whole our-dad-was-way-crazy-but-let's-just-gloss-right-over-that-shall-we situation."
A Christmas Carol,1,14,"So, fine then, dead sister, got it."
A Christmas Carol,1,15,"Now, it's on to stop number three, where Scrooge remembers how awesomely he partied that one Christmas at the house of his master Fezziwig with his BFF and fellow apprentice, Dick Wilkins. Dudes, that party was totally off the hook!"
A Christmas Carol,1,16,"Also, it's the first nice Christmas scene we've gotten so far—the point being that just for a few bucks, Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig make a whole bunch of neighborhood apprentice kids happy for a few hours and are then remembered with affection forever. Or something like that."
A Christmas Carol,1,17,"Scrooge immediately gets the point of this. By contrast he's been kind of a jerko to his own clerk. He's really pretty quick on the uptake, no?"
A Christmas Carol,1,18,On to the next glimpse into the past: the Christmas when Scrooge really starts turning into the greedy old hobgoblin we know and love.
A Christmas Carol,1,19,"In the scene, a slightly older Scrooge sits with his fiancée who straight up accuses him of loving money more than her. He's all, ""Um, but I can still love you second-best, right? And also, money is really totally important!"" But she is not having it, and breaks off the engagement. He doesn't really argue."
A Christmas Carol,1,20,"Finally, one last thingie from the Ghost of Christmas Past, which turns out to be basically the Dickensian equivalent of Beyoncé's ""if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it."""
A Christmas Carol,1,21,"The ex-fiancée is now sitting in the middle of her huge family, with a whole bunch of kids happily running around, and a husband who totally loves her and them and is just completely the kind of Prince Charming that Scrooge would never have been. The happiness is so absolute that it's a little suspicious. Or maybe Shmoop's just getting cynical in its old age."
A Christmas Carol,1,22,"Anyway, just like that, these super happy people just happen to mention crazy old Scrooge, who the husband says is all alone, now that Marley is on the verge of death. Wow, what a coincidence that they would just happen to talk about him right then!"
A Christmas Carol,1,23,"Scrooge can't take any more of this all of a sudden. He grabs the extinguisher cap thing and tries to smother the kid/grandpa ghost with it. Wow, that's like Chekhov's gun! You just knew that thing was going to be used at some point as soon as Dickens described it when the ghost first showed up."
A Christmas Carol,1,24,"The ghost kind of melts into the floorboards and Scrooge falls asleep, which is clearly his go-to method of coping with a crisis. We prefer chocolate."
A Christmas Carol,0,0,"Boom, we start just like that with the narrator busting out the fact that Marley is 100% dead. Dead, dead, dead, dead."
A Christmas Carol,0,1,"His old business partner Scrooge is alive though, and still runs the same small company they used to run together. It's not really clear what this company actually does, but it doesn't really matter for the purposes of the story. Basically, it's some kind of middleman operation, where they don't make anything, and just sit around doing bookkeeping all day long. Or something. Dickens wasn't really up too much on the ins and outs of businesses."
A Christmas Carol,0,2,"Anyway, Scrooge turns out to be the grumpiest grumper that ever grumped. And also, he's pretty greedy. And worst of all? He is all head, no heart. This is a big no-no in Dickens's world, so we're guessing someone's about to learn a lesson about feelings."
A Christmas Carol,0,3,"On Christmas Eve, Scrooge is in his office, counting money and watching his clerk. Everything is as shoddy as possible, because Scrooge doesn't want to spend an extra cent even on heating the place if he doesn't have to."
A Christmas Carol,0,4,"His nephew bursts in and is all, La-la-la, Merry Christmas!"
A Christmas Carol,0,5,"Scrooge throws out his famous catchphrase—say it with him now—""Bah! Humbug!"" Okay, it's no ""Leggo My Eggo,"" but still."
A Christmas Carol,0,6,"The nephew wants Scrooge to come over for Christmas dinner, but Scrooge isn't having any of it. Scrooge doesn't get what the big deal about Christmas is, and calls everyone else a jerk and an idiot for not being depressed by being in debt and not using that day to work more to try to pay it off."
A Christmas Carol,0,7,"The nephew is like, but what about the whole Jesus's birth thing? And the whole being nice to other people thing? Nice try, dude."
A Christmas Carol,0,8,"Scrooge makes him leave, but not before insulting his marriage because it's based on love. (Hey, you know whom Shmoop would love to have over for family dinner? That crazy old uncle who hates us and insults our spouse. You kind of have to wonder why this nephew is so dead set on having this horrible man come by. Shmoop's going to go all cynical here and say the nephew wants to bank that inheritance! Okay, fine, he's totally not. We just don't really get why he's so fixated on Scrooge coming.)"
A Christmas Carol,0,9,Right. Where were we?
A Christmas Carol,0,10,"Oh, yes. A couple of guys show up asking for any donations for the poor. Scrooge tells them to go stuff it, and argues that anyone who is poor can either go to jail, go to the workhouse (basically, jail for poor people where you have to work), or die. He successfully harshes their mellow and they take off."
A Christmas Carol,0,11,Someone comes by to try to carol and Scrooge almost hits him in the face with a ruler.
A Christmas Carol,0,12,"Scrooge then turns on the clerk and grudgingly gives him Christmas Day off with half pay—or as he calls it, the one day a year when the clerk is allowed to rob him."
A Christmas Carol,0,13,"Finally, the day is done, and Scrooge goes home to his apartment. It's worth noting that he lives in a building that is otherwise all offices, so there's no one else around to hear him scream."
A Christmas Carol,0,14,"Just as he is about to go in the door, the doorknocker… turns into the face of his dead partner Marley! Eek!"
A Christmas Carol,0,15,"But then it's okay, and Scrooge is only very mildly freaked out. He checks around the house, but everything seems hunky-dory."
A Christmas Carol,0,16,"He sits down to eat his sad little dinner (and honestly, we do have to point out that he is so consistent in treating everyone like dirt that he treats himself the same way as well). Just then, all the bells in the house start to ring."
A Christmas Carol,0,17,"Then, the door from the cellar bursts open and out of it comes… Marley's ghost! All wrapped up in chains that are a literal mockery of his business life, made out of keys and locks and money purses and cash-boxes."
A Christmas Carol,0,18,"Scrooge is pretty impressive here. He is clearly really freaking out, but still manages to smart-mouth this ghostly horror for a while."
A Christmas Carol,0,19,"Finally, the ghost gets a word in edge-wise, makes its jaw fall off its head to prove that stuff is about to get real, and reveals a couple of things:Ghosts of terrible people have to endlessly work to make the world a better place.Marley has gotten Scrooge a chance to reform himself.Three ghosts are coming."
A Christmas Carol,0,20,Ghosts of terrible people have to endlessly work to make the world a better place.
A Christmas Carol,0,21,Marley has gotten Scrooge a chance to reform himself.
A Christmas Carol,0,22,Three ghosts are coming.
A Christmas Carol,0,23,"Then the ghost goes out the window and Scrooge sees it join a whole mishmash of miserable ghosts, all of whom are similarly chained with the physical manifestations of their misdeeds. Scrooge realizes that he knew a bunch of them when they were alive."
A Christmas Carol,0,24,The fog sets in and the ghosts fade from view.
A Christmas Carol,0,25,"Scrooge tries to shake the whole experience off, finds that he can't, and instead just goes to sleep, 'cause, why not?"
Siddhartha,10,0,"Siddhartha feels warm toward the ordinary people whom he transports across the river. Rather than the contempt that he previously felt, he now sees their troubles as understandable and honorable."
Siddhartha,10,1,"Siddhartha considers the possibility that his awareness of the unity of the universe, too, is mere childishness, but this idea doesn’t bother him."
Siddhartha,10,2,"Although Siddhartha grows wiser and wiser, he still feels wounded by his son."
Siddhartha,10,3,"One day, Siddhartha intends to go into the town to look for his son. Then Siddhartha remembers that he himself wasn’t exactly a model son. He had left his own father the way his son left him."
Siddhartha,10,4,He hears the river laugh at the repetition of life’s patterns.
Siddhartha,10,5,Siddhartha returns to his hut and tells Vasudeva of his experience in the town where Vasudeva had found him and about his intention of going into the town earlier that day.
Siddhartha,10,6,Siddhartha recognizes Vasudeva as God himself. Whoa.
Siddhartha,10,7,Vasudeva brings Siddhartha out to the river and tells him there is something he has still not heard.
Siddhartha,10,8,"With Vasudeva’s guidance, Siddhartha listens intently. For the first time he hears all the voices of the river as one single continuum of all life."
Siddhartha,10,9,Siddhartha feels his soul merge into unity.
Siddhartha,10,10,Vasudeva touches Siddhartha on the shoulder.
Siddhartha,10,11,"Now that Siddhartha has reached enlightenment, Vasudeva plans to leave the river and enter into the unity of all things."
Siddhartha,10,12,"Vasudeva takes off for the forest, leaving Siddhartha as the ferryman."
Siddhartha,11,0,"Govinda is still traveling with the men in yellow robes. They look up to him now because he’s wise and old, but Govinda is still unsatisfied and seeks enlightenment."
Siddhartha,11,1,Govinda hears about this wise ferryman and decides to go talk to him.
Siddhartha,11,2,That ferryman is Siddhartha.
Siddhartha,11,3,Govinda doesn’t realize this.
Siddhartha,11,4,"Siddhartha tells Govinda that because he is orienting himself toward a single goal, he is missing everything."
Siddhartha,11,5,"Okay we know that’s counter-intuitive. Siddhartha is arguing that because Govinda is focused so much on the search, he cannot find what he is searching for. Mull that over."
Siddhartha,11,6,Siddhartha identifies himself to Govinda.
Siddhartha,11,7,Govinda is startled.
Siddhartha,11,8,"The following morning, Govinda questions Siddhartha about whether he follows a doctrine. Siddhartha explains that although he has had many teachers, he follows no doctrine."
Siddhartha,11,9,"Siddhartha explains his belief that although knowledge can be communicated, wisdom cannot."
Siddhartha,11,10,"He argues that in every truth, the opposite is also true, that time is illusory, that suffering is necessary to learning, and that there is no division between the world and perfection."
Siddhartha,11,11,"Siddhartha uses a stone as an example for Govinda. The stone, because of its profound stone-like nature, is everything. And everything is enough."
Siddhartha,11,12,"Siddhartha does not dwell on ideas, and does not fight to understand reality."
Siddhartha,11,13,"Although Siddhartha’s words contradict Gotama Buddha’s, that doesn’t matter. Words are meaningless."
Siddhartha,11,14,"Huh? Govinda is confused. Before leaving, he asks Siddhartha for any final words of wisdom."
Siddhartha,11,15,Siddhartha tells Govinda to kiss him on the forehead.
Siddhartha,11,16,"Govinda kisses his friend’s forehead and suddenly sees a continuous, unending stream of faces and people and images of painful and joyous things all shifting into one another."
Siddhartha,11,17,"After kissing Siddhartha, he is unsure if a single second or eternity has passed."
Siddhartha,11,18,"Govinda identifies Siddhartha’s smiling, radiant face as that of the Buddha and bows down in veneration."
Siddhartha,8,0,Siddhartha observes the river and realizes that every movement of the water is new.
Siddhartha,8,1,He is painfully hungry and finds the ferryman he met years before. The man’s name is Vasudeva.
Siddhartha,8,2,"Siddhartha asks for a ride across the river. He has no money to offer the ferryman, but asks if Vasudeva will accept his fine clothes. The ferryman is confused, but agrees."
Siddhartha,8,3,Siddhartha asks if can move in with Vasudeva and learn about the river as the ferryman’s apprentice.
Siddhartha,8,4,Vasudeva graciously invites Siddhartha to stay in his home and offers him a meal.
Siddhartha,8,5,Siddhartha eats a simple plate of bread and mango and recounts his life to Vasudeva. He is astounded by the Ferryman’s profound ability to listen.
Siddhartha,8,6,"Vasudeva remarks that he cannot teach, but that he can help Siddhartha to learn from the river—to learn how to be devout and to listen."
Siddhartha,8,7,"Vasudeva rarely speaks, but the men work hard together and focus on listening to the river."
Siddhartha,8,8,"It says to them, ""Come in for a dip!"""
Siddhartha,8,9,"More accurately, the river teaches the two men about life."
Siddhartha,8,10,"For instance, one day Siddhartha realizes that the river exists only in the present: it is everywhere at once, upstream, downstream, at the sea, and at the source. Life is the same way. Siddhartha realizes that his existence as a boy and his existence as an old man are not separate. Everything has its existence in the present."
Siddhartha,8,11,"In the voice of the river Siddhartha hears the holy word ""Om"" being repeated over and over again."
Siddhartha,8,12,"Vasudeva and Siddhartha live joyously on the river, listening to its stories and finding silent companionship in one another. Travelers begin mistaking the two for brothers."
Siddhartha,8,13,One day Siddhartha learns from traveling monks that Gotama Buddha is gravely ill and will die.
Siddhartha,8,14,"Meanwhile, Kamala has joined the followers of the Buddha and is making a pilgrimage to see the holy man. She rests on the riverbank with her son, who is tired and wants to eat. While resting, Kamala is bitten by a snake."
Siddhartha,8,15,Vasudeva hears her scream and brings her home.
Siddhartha,8,16,Siddhartha immediately recognizes Kamala (she’s still gorgeous).
Siddhartha,8,17,He also realizes that the boy is his son.
Siddhartha,8,18,They clean her wound but she is badly poisoned. Siddhartha calms his crying son.
Siddhartha,8,19,"When she regains consciousness, Kamala recognizes Siddhartha but sees how profoundly he has changed."
Siddhartha,8,20,She dies before she is able to tell Siddhartha that finding him was as good as it would have been to find Gotama Buddha.
Siddhartha,8,21,"Siddhartha sits with Kamala for a long time after she dies. Later he sits awake and listens to the river. While he suffers, the river offers him a sense of unity. Siddhartha becomes peaceful."
Siddhartha,8,22,"In the morning, Vasudeva helps him construct a funeral pyre."
Siddhartha,9,0,Siddhartha’s son grieves for Kamala. Siddhartha treats him with consideration and respect although he realizes the boy has been spoiled by a wealthy lifestyle.
Siddhartha,9,1,"Siddhartha struggles to try to win his son’s love and acceptance with kindness, but his efforts are in vain."
Siddhartha,9,2,"His son came to the river out of necessity, not desire. The kid wants out of the boondocks."
Siddhartha,9,3,"Siddhartha wishes desperately to protect his son from pain and suffering, but is reminded by Vasudeva and the wisdom of the river that one cannot teach certain things. They must be learned through experience."
Siddhartha,9,4,"Although Siddhartha understands the concept, his love for his son is overwhelming. He cannot bear to let the boy go."
Siddhartha,9,5,"Siddhartha’s son feels trapped by his father’s endless kindness. After a huge you-just-don’t-get-me-Dad! outburst, the young man steals money and a boat and runs away."
Siddhartha,9,6,Siddhartha and Vasudeva construct a raft to rescue the boat.
Siddhartha,9,7,"Vasudeva advises Siddhartha to let the boy return to the city, but Siddhartha wants to bring his son back."
Siddhartha,9,8,"Siddhartha searches the forest. He enters the town sad, but no longer worried, and stands near the gate where he first saw Kamala. He relives the moments of his life and feels a sense of profound emptiness."
Siddhartha,9,9,"He crouches by the gate in meditation on the hot, dusty road."
Siddhartha,9,10,"A monk from Kamala’s garden places two bananas in front of him (which, it seems, is a generous meal by the book’s standards), but Siddhartha is deep in meditation and doesn’t notice."
Siddhartha,9,11,Vasudeva finds Siddhartha. Siddhartha greets him happily and they return home. Neither speaks of the boy.
Siddhartha,2,0,"Siddhartha and Govinda arrive in a Jetavana grove, which is the happening spot for Gotama Buddha."
Siddhartha,2,1,They spend the night; in the morning they find that a massive crowd has gathered to hear the Buddha speak. Siddhartha and Govinda are immediately able to identify the Buddha (he’s the godly one) among the crowd of Yellow-Robed Men. There are a lot of Yellow-Robed Men.
Siddhartha,2,2,"The Buddha appears endlessly peaceful, light, quiet, and contented."
Siddhartha,2,3,"Although Siddhartha feels there is little new information he can learn from the Buddha’s teachings, he intently studies the Buddha’s behavior."
Siddhartha,2,4,"The Buddha teaches all the usual stuff, including the Four Noble Truths and the Eight Fold path. Govinda asks to be accepted into his community of followers."
Siddhartha,2,5,Govinda is accepted and urges Siddhartha to join him.
Siddhartha,2,6,"While Siddhartha recognizes the Buddha’s holiness, he believes enlightenment must be experienced, not taught."
Siddhartha,2,7,The two men stop in the woods to speak with the Buddha.
Siddhartha,2,8,"Siddhartha admires the Buddha’s teaching that the world is a complete, unbroken chain of cause and effect. However, he doesn’t understand the doctrine of salvation and escape from the world if in fact the world is eternally one."
Siddhartha,2,9,"The Buddha admits the flaw, but reminds Siddhartha that the goal of his teachings is to relieve suffering, not to describe the universe."
Siddhartha,2,10,"Siddhartha argues the impossibility of reaching enlightenment via others’ teachings. Enlightenment, Siddhartha says, is something a man must do alone."
Siddhartha,2,11,The Buddha smiles and departs.
Siddhartha,3,0,"As he walks away from Govinda, Siddhartha realizes that he is embarking on a new stage of life. He has walked away from all his teachers, even Buddha, because they cannot teach the nature of the self."
Siddhartha,3,1,Siddhartha decides to learn from himself alone.
Siddhartha,3,2,"As he walks, Siddhartha sees his surroundings as real and beautiful, rather than an illusion that causes suffering."
Siddhartha,3,3,"For the first time, Siddhartha is experiencing the world on its own terms, rather than scorning what it has to teach him. This is his awakening."
Siddhartha,3,4,"Siddhartha decides he has to start anew on his quest for enlightenment. Concurrent to this decision is the realization that he is completely alone. He has left his father, he has left the Samanas, and he has left Govinda with the Yellow-Robed Men. He can no longer define himself in relation to other men because he has no community."
Siddhartha,5,0,"Siddhartha goes to see Kamaswami, the wealthy merchant."
Siddhartha,5,1,The merchant questions him about his skills and needs.
Siddhartha,5,2,"Siddhartha has no needs and argues that his ability to fast is an asset: he’s not troubled by the lack of food, therefore no one can force him to do something for food. It has also taught him patience."
Siddhartha,5,3,"When the merchant sees that Siddhartha can read and write well, he offers Siddhartha both a job and shelter."
Siddhartha,5,4,"Siddhartha begins to live a good life: food, baths, clothes."
Siddhartha,5,5,"Siddhartha learns quickly and is well-respected by Kamaswami. However, he looks at his job as a game; his real interests lie with Kamala."
Siddhartha,5,6,"Kamaswami keeps trying to get Siddhartha to be more passionate about business, but Siddhartha remains indifferent."
Siddhartha,5,7,Siddhartha visits Kamala daily and she instructs him in the physical act of love. Go read that part; we can’t do it justice.
Siddhartha,5,8,"Although he takes great pleasure in the people around him, his experience as a Samana keeps Siddhartha from fully empathizing with them. He sees their lives as if from a distance; their pains, discomforts, and problems seem completely trivial to him."
Siddhartha,5,9,Siddhartha feels understood and satisfied only with Kamala.
Siddhartha,5,10,"Siddhartha sees that Kamala has the same stillness that he has. He points out that this quality has nothing to do with intelligence, but everything to do with the resolving to have Inner Peace."
Siddhartha,5,11,Kamala tells Siddhartha that he is the best lover she’s had. She wants to eventually have a child with him.
Siddhartha,5,12,"The lovers note that because they share this special sanctuary and distance from the normal ups and downs of life, they can never truly love each other the way other people do."
Siddhartha,4,0,Siddhartha continues to appreciate his surroundings and decides to always obey his inner voice and to seek experience.
Siddhartha,4,1,He comes to a river and befriends the ferryman.
Siddhartha,4,2,He crashes for the night at the ferryman’s bachelor pad and dreams about Govinda.
Siddhartha,4,3,Let’s check out this dream.
Siddhartha,4,4,"Govinda, wearing a yellow robe, approaches Siddhartha and hugs him."
Siddhartha,4,5,"Two seconds later, Govinda transforms into a woman."
Siddhartha,4,6,Siddhartha nurses from the woman’s beautiful breast and experiences the world. The woman has some seriously intense milk.
Siddhartha,4,7,"The next morning, a ferryman takes Siddhartha across the river."
Siddhartha,4,8,"The ferryman tells Siddhartha about learning from the river, which is the Most Beautiful River Ever."
Siddhartha,4,9,Siddhartha expresses regret that he cannot pay the ferryman.
Siddhartha,4,10,"The ferryman tells him that he can chalk it up as pro bono work. But more importantly, the ferryman has faith that Siddhartha will someday return."
Siddhartha,4,11,Siddhartha continues walking until he reaches a village. Everyone stays away from the weird ascetic (him).
Siddhartha,4,12,Siddhartha comes to a stream where he meets a young woman washing clothes.
Siddhartha,4,13,"They flirt, and then she invites him to have sex with her by stepping on his foot. We’re not sure how this works, to be honest, but Siddhartha bends down and kisses her nipple. (He’s still thinking about his dream.)"
Siddhartha,4,14,"Although he wants to sleep with her, he’s never touched a woman before and gets cold feet. His inner voice says ""no,"" so he leaves."
Siddhartha,4,15,Siddhartha arrives at the outskirts of a city in a beautifully fenced grove. He sees a woman ride by on a sedan chair with a whole entourage of servants.
Siddhartha,4,16,She’s gorgeous.
Siddhartha,4,17,"He makes eye contact with her. She smiles and nods. Chemistry? Yes, definitely."
Siddhartha,4,18,She and her servants go inside the grove.
Siddhartha,4,19,"Siddhartha wants to follow her, but then realizes that he still looks like a Samana, i.e., a dirty beggar."
Siddhartha,4,20,"He learns that the woman’s name is Kamala and that she is a famous courtesan. He now has a goal. We don’t know what this goal is yet, but Siddhartha has it."
Siddhartha,4,21,"He bathes, shaves, oils his hair, and arranges an appointment with her."
Siddhartha,4,22,Siddhartha asks Kamala to be his friend and teacher (in the art of Sexual Healing). Ah. Could this be his goal?
Siddhartha,4,23,Kamala finds it vaguely ridiculous that an ascetic from the forest wearing a loincloth has come to her for a sexual education.
Siddhartha,4,24,"Kamala tells Siddhartha to get a job, lots of money, nice clothes, some perfume, and some nice presents for her. Then he can try talking to her again."
Siddhartha,4,25,"Siddhartha asks Kamala for some advice on where to get clothes, shoes, and money."
Siddhartha,4,26,"He gives her an overview of his resume: the ability to think, starve, and compose poetry."
Siddhartha,4,27,"Siddhartha composes a poem for Kamala on the spot. She loves it, so she offers him one kiss. One super-hot kiss."
Siddhartha,4,28,Siddhartha is stunned and wants more.
Siddhartha,4,29,We learn that knowing how to read and write is rare in ancient India.
Siddhartha,4,30,"Another visitor arrives; Siddhartha is quickly ushered out and offered a long, white robe."
Siddhartha,4,31,"Although he is hungry, Siddhartha feels it isn’t right to beg for food now that he is no longer a Samana."
Siddhartha,4,32,"The next day, he goes to see Kamala. She has set up a job interview for him with a wealthy merchant."
Siddhartha,4,33,"Siddhartha tells Kamala that he is determined to have her, and that the Samanas taught him how to single-mindedly focus on a goal."
Siddhartha,1,0,Govinda and Siddhartha find some Samanas and join them in their Who Can Go the Longest Without Eating contest.
Siddhartha,1,1,"Siddhartha gives away his clothes, begins fasting for long periods, and eats only once a day when he’s not fasting."
Siddhartha,1,2,"Through self-torture, Siddhartha aims to completely empty himself in order to identify with the world around him."
Siddhartha,1,3,"He engages in a number of Feats of Strength (not to be attempted at home): standing in the burning sun without water, standing in the freezing rain without an umbrella, standing in a thorny bush without… well, just standing in a thorny bush. Essentially, he stands until he loses feeling and escapes himself."
Siddhartha,1,4,"Siddhartha likes losing himself, but he always finds himself again. The self-denial of the Samanas isn’t enough to enlighten him."
Siddhartha,1,5,Siddhartha asks Govinda (remember him?) if they’re making any progress.
Siddhartha,1,6,Govinda says they’re making lots of progress.
Siddhartha,1,7,"Siddhartha doesn’t think so. If the point of all the Feats of Strength is to lose himself, he argues, he could just as easily lose himself in prostitutes and drinking. He tells Govinda that he will leave the Samanas."
Siddhartha,1,8,Siddhartha and Govinda have spent three years with the Samanas. They learn of a man named Gotama Buddha who has achieved enlightenment. Everyone is gossiping about him.
Siddhartha,1,9,Govinda thinks they should hear the Buddha’s teachings. Siddhartha and Govinda nag each other for a while and then decide to leave the Samanas.
Siddhartha,1,10,"Siddhartha informs the oldest Samana of their decision. The old man gets angry, but Siddhartha hypnotizes him with a powerful glance. The old Samana politely permits them to leave."
Siddhartha,1,11,Govinda is impressed. Siddhartha has learned a lot from the Samanas. Govinda argues that Siddhartha could have learned to walk on water if he had continued with the Feats of Strength.
Siddhartha,0,0,"The novel opens with this guy named Siddhartha in ancient India. He and his best friend, Govinda, belong to the elite Brahman caste, which means that they're top of the heap and super-rich."
Siddhartha,0,1,Siddhartha is the Golden Boy of his community: men want to be him and women want to be with him.
Siddhartha,0,2,"Even though Siddhartha participates in holy sacrifices, meditation practices, and discussions with the adult Brahmans, he’s not satisfied. He seeks enlightenment (otherwise known as Inner Peace) and feels that he has learned all he can from his teachers and books."
Siddhartha,0,3,"In times like this, meditation under the banyan tree is the only solution."
Siddhartha,0,4,Siddhartha and Govinda sit and meditate.
Siddhartha,0,5,"At dinnertime, Govinda gets up, but Siddhartha remains deep in contemplation. He reflects on the word ""Om,"" which means ""the completion."" It is the word that concludes all Brahman prayers."
Siddhartha,0,6,He’s thinking about a group of Samanas (wandering ascetics) who once came into his town.
Siddhartha,0,7,He leaves the banyan tree and tells his parents about his new career path.
Siddhartha,0,8,"As soon as Siddhartha tells his father about his plans to become a Samana, his father gets upset and leaves the room."
Siddhartha,0,9,"Siddhartha remains in the room, standing in the same position."
Siddhartha,0,10,"The following morning, Siddhartha is still standing there."
Siddhartha,0,11,His father recognizes Siddhartha’s determination and gives the young man permission to go.
Siddhartha,0,12,"We call this the traumatic version of leaving for college, except instead of ""college,"" it's ""wandering around with no food for weeks on end."""
Siddhartha,0,13,Siddhartha meets up with Govinda and they leave to find the ascetics.
Siddhartha,6,0,"As the years go by and Siddhartha accrues more and more wealth, his Samana-like qualities begin to fade."
Siddhartha,6,1,"They are replaced with more Material Girl-like qualities. He grows increasingly greedy, troubled by everyday problems, and unhappy. He feels trapped by pleasure, pain, and a sense of self-hatred."
Siddhartha,6,2,Siddhartha engages in a lot of high-stakes gambling as way of expressing his hatred of wealth.
Siddhartha,6,3,He feels himself and Kamala aging. He suddenly starts associating sex with death.
Siddhartha,6,4,"One evening, Siddhartha drinks heavily, watches dancers, and feels profoundly nauseated with himself. Finally, he falls asleep and dreams about a songbird that belongs to Kamala. In the dream, he finds the bird dead and he tosses it into the street."
Siddhartha,6,5,He becomes scared that he has just tossed out all the goodness in himself.
Siddhartha,6,6,"In despair, Siddhartha recalls his life. He tries to remember the moments when he felt true joy and a sense of direction. He concludes that nothing in his life is of value to him. Even the pleasures of his shared passion with Kamala have worn off (and this is saying something… Kamala’s got skills). Everything has been a game to him."
Siddhartha,6,7,He leaves his home and his riches.
Siddhartha,6,8,"Kamaswami sends people out to look for Siddhartha, thinking that he has been captured by robbers."
Siddhartha,6,9,"Kamala does not search for him. She knows Siddhartha is, at heart, a wandering Samana. She releases her songbird from its cage."
Siddhartha,6,10,We learn Kamala is pregnant with Siddhartha’s child.
Siddhartha,7,0,"Siddhartha heads for the forest, determined never to go back to his life of wealth."
Siddhartha,7,1,He is depressed.
Siddhartha,7,2,He wanders.
Siddhartha,7,3,He is depressed some more.
Siddhartha,7,4,Siddhartha approaches the same river where he met the ferryman years before.
Siddhartha,7,5,In utter despair he clings to a coconut tree along the bank. He dreams about dropping and submerging himself into the water. He sees the water as mirroring the emptiness within him.
Siddhartha,7,6,"About to slip into the water, the word ""Om"" emanates from his soul."
Siddhartha,7,7,"Siddhartha realizes that destroying his body will not end his suffering, and he sits down. Thoroughly exhausted, he falls asleep."
Siddhartha,7,8,"Siddhartha wakes up with a sense of rebirth and repeats ""Om"" to himself over and over."
Siddhartha,7,9,"Behind him, Siddhartha notices a monk in a yellow robe."
Siddhartha,7,10,It’s Govinda!
Siddhartha,7,11,Govinda has not recognized Siddhartha but merely sat beside him while he slept in order to protect him from snakes.
Siddhartha,7,12,"Siddhartha’s like, ""dude, it’s me,"" and Govinda’s like, ""dude, what’s with the rich-man outfit?"""
Siddhartha,7,13,Siddhartha explains he has left the world of wealth and is now on a pilgrimage. Govinda leaves to get back to being a monk.
Siddhartha,7,14,Siddhartha forces himself to think. He has no possessions and thus feels joyful and childlike.
Siddhartha,7,15,Siddhartha finds himself amused at the course his life has taken and sees his life’s path reflected in the flow of the river.
Siddhartha,7,16,"Siddhartha concludes that in order to return to himself, he has had to experience profound sorrow."
Siddhartha,7,17,"He realizes that life as a Samana fueled his intellectual growth and arrogance, allowing him to thrive rather than to perish."
Siddhartha,7,18,Siddhartha remains entranced by the beauty and flow of the river.
Ethan Frome,10,0,(The Epilogue is told by the first-person narrator we met in the Prologue.
Ethan Frome,10,1,It picks up where said Prologue lets off.)
Ethan Frome,10,2,"The narrator walked into the kitchen, but couldn't tell which of the two women had been talking on and in an argumentative tone."
Ethan Frome,10,3,"The tall, skinny woman stood up without greeting the narrator."
Ethan Frome,10,4,"She's finishing up with the cooking, now that Ethan is home."
Ethan Frome,10,5,"The other woman is very small. She was gnarled in a chair. Her hair was gray, and her eyes moved wildly, like the eyes of a person with spinal disease."
Ethan Frome,10,6,The kitchen was one of the poorest the narrator had ever seen.
Ethan Frome,10,7,"Ethan remarked about the chill in the room, and moved to see to the fire."
Ethan Frome,10,8,The woman who was cooking didn't respond.
Ethan Frome,10,9,But the other woman piped up right away. She complained that Zeena had been sleeping and had almost left her to freeze to death.
Ethan Frome,10,10,The narrator knew that this was the woman who had been talking before.
Ethan Frome,10,11,"Ethan introduces the narrator first to his wife (the one cooking) and then to the other one, Mattie Silver…"
Ethan Frome,10,12,Mrs. Hale (Ruth Varnum) had been very worried about the narrator and was amazed to hear he had spent the night at the Frome place.
Ethan Frome,10,13,"Apparently, the narrator might be the first person to have been in the house in ""over twenty years"" (Epilogue.23)."
Ethan Frome,10,14,Ethan is too proud to let his friends see what a miserable situation he has.
Ethan Frome,10,15,"Mrs. Varnum used to visit, awkward as it was, and even now tried to go out there twice a year."
Ethan Frome,10,16,She tries to avoid going when Ethan is there.
Ethan Frome,10,17,Looking at Mattie and Zeena together is bad enough without having to see Ethan with them.
Ethan Frome,10,18,The narrator agreed that it wasn't pleasant to see Ethan with them.
Ethan Frome,10,19,She remembers how Ethan looked before.
Ethan Frome,10,20,Ruth remembers the night of the accident.
Ethan Frome,10,21,"Since her house was near the accident site, they brought Mattie into the room the narrator was using."
Ethan Frome,10,22,Mattie was going to be one of Ruth's bridesmaids.
Ethan Frome,10,23,Ruth had stayed with her until she woke.
Ethan Frome,10,24,"The following day rumor had it that Zeena had tried to send Mattie out of town, and that for some reason Ethan and Mattie had been sledding when they were supposed to be driving to the train."
Ethan Frome,10,25,"Nobody in town had any idea how Zeena felt about that situation, but after the accident she asked to have Mattie move back."
Ethan Frome,10,26,"From then on, the three lived there together."
Ethan Frome,10,27,Zeena takes care of Mattie and Ethan.
Ethan Frome,10,28,"When Ethan and Mattie became injured, Zeena's health suddenly returned."
Ethan Frome,10,29,"It's a bad scene. Sometimes Mattie and Zeena argue, and it looks like it's killing Ethan. From what the narrator can see, it looks like all three people have horrible lives."
Ethan Frome,10,30,Mrs. Hale said that Mattie almost didn't survive the crash – she wishes she hadn't.
Ethan Frome,10,31,"She believes that if Mattie hadn't have survived, perhaps Ethan could have found some kind of life."
Ethan Frome,10,32,"She thinks there isn't much difference between the dead Fromes and the living ones, except that the dead women are quiet, while the live women are not."
Ethan Frome,8,0,Ethan has a little make-shift study that he hadn't used in a while be because the heater that previously heated it was given to Mattie for her room.
Ethan Frome,8,1,"When Zeena was safely sleeping, Ethan headed to that room."
Ethan Frome,8,2,"He and Mattie hadn't talked after the scene, but when he'd come in from doing his final chores he found a note left by Mattie before she went to bed."
Ethan Frome,8,3,"It said, ""Don't trouble, Ethan."""
Ethan Frome,8,4,This was his first note ever from Mattie.
Ethan Frome,8,5,The note makes him feel closer to her.
Ethan Frome,8,6,"Wrestling with his mind, Ethan decides he can have happiness."
Ethan Frome,8,7,He doesn't have to live this way.
Ethan Frome,8,8,There was this guy who left his wife for a younger woman.
Ethan Frome,8,9,"By leaving her the farm, the man had made sure the left wife would have something to live on, and moved West."
Ethan Frome,8,10,Ethan had met the couple and seen their cute little baby.
Ethan Frome,8,11,He decides to write Zeena a letter and then leave with Mattie the next day.
Ethan Frome,8,12,As he writes he begins to have doubts.
Ethan Frome,8,13,"The farm isn't worth anything to sell, and there is no way Zeena could do any of the work on it."
Ethan Frome,8,14,"Oh well, he thinks. She can go live with her relatives and he will eventually pay her alimony."
Ethan Frome,8,15,He finds a newspaper so he can look at the cost of a trip West.
Ethan Frome,8,16,"Crushed, Ethan learns that he can't even afford the cheapest ticket, and nobody would loan him any money."
Ethan Frome,8,17,He cries and falls asleep thinking of how he and Mattie were supposed to sled tonight.
Ethan Frome,8,18,"When he wakes up, he realizes it's Mattie's final day on the farm."
Ethan Frome,8,19,Mattie is waiting for him.
Ethan Frome,8,20,She'd heard him leave the house last night and had not heard him return.
Ethan Frome,8,21,They move to the kitchen.
Ethan Frome,8,22,"Ethan touches Mattie and says, ""I don't want you should trouble either"" (8.24)."
Ethan Frome,8,23,She agrees not to.
Ethan Frome,8,24,Ethan warns her not to let Zeena get to her today.
Ethan Frome,8,25,When Jotham comes in he tells Ethan that Zeena asked him to drive Mattie away.
Ethan Frome,8,26,Ethan says that he will be the one to drive Mattie.
Ethan Frome,8,27,When Zeena comes in she tells Mattie she's arranged for her trunk to be transported.
Ethan Frome,8,28,Mattie thanks her.
Ethan Frome,8,29,"Determined to give it another shot, Ethan decides to use Zeena's illness as an excuse to get Andrew Hale to loan him some money."
Ethan Frome,8,30,"Mrs. Hale is very sweet to him, and tells him she feels bad that he's had such a hard life."
Ethan Frome,8,31,He hadn't experienced that level of kindness in some time.
Ethan Frome,8,32,This increased his confidence in getting the loan.
Ethan Frome,8,33,But he can't go through with it.
Ethan Frome,8,34,"He sees himself as a man about to swindle two elderly people who believe in him, and then abandon a sick woman."
Ethan Frome,8,35,Ethan walks back home.
Ethan Frome,9,0,"Back in the kitchen, Ethan finds Zeena reading a book about kidney problems."
Ethan Frome,9,1,Mattie apparently is moving her trunk.
Ethan Frome,9,2,"Appalled that she is moving the heavy thing without manly aid, Ethan jumps up to go help her."
Ethan Frome,9,3,He finds her crying in her room.
Ethan Frome,9,4,She thought that Ethan wasn't going to see her off.
Ethan Frome,9,5,Zeena calls to them that it's time for Mattie to be headed on with her ride.
Ethan Frome,9,6,Ethan whispers in Mattie's ear that he plans to drive her.
Ethan Frome,9,7,"Zeena tells him he can't, and he defies her."
Ethan Frome,9,8,They fight but he has his way.
Ethan Frome,9,9,In a fury he readies the horse and hitches it to the sleigh.
Ethan Frome,9,10,Ethan finds Mattie in his study.
Ethan Frome,9,11,Zeena has gone to bed without saying a word to Mattie.
Ethan Frome,9,12,"Smiling, Ethan tells Mattie they can enjoy their drive together."
Ethan Frome,9,13,"Ethan takes the scenic route, and heads to Shadow Pond, where Ethan and Mattie had once shared a picnic lunch together."
Ethan Frome,9,14,"She had asked him to a town picnic; he had refused, but later joined her."
Ethan Frome,9,15,"They try to drink in ever moment with each other, and Ethan tries to discuss her future."
Ethan Frome,9,16,"Again, her situation is really desperate. She has no one else who loves her in the world."
Ethan Frome,9,17,"(In the early 1900s, a single woman with no money was a hard thing to be.)"
Ethan Frome,9,18,"Ethan breaks down, telling her that he had tried to find a way to run away with her but couldn't."
Ethan Frome,9,19,Mattie shows him that she found the letter he started to write to Zeena.
Ethan Frome,9,20,"Begging, Ethan asks Mattie if she would have run away with him if he'd asked her to."
Ethan Frome,9,21,"She admits she's fantasized about the very thing, almost since the first time she met him."
Ethan Frome,9,22,"Mattie asks Ethan to write to her, but he thinks writing would be a terribly poor substitute for the real thing."
Ethan Frome,9,23,He asks if she will get married.
Ethan Frome,9,24,She tells him he's the only one for her.
Ethan Frome,9,25,Soon they are near the sledding spot.
Ethan Frome,9,26,"It's dark, but they decide to take a sled before they go to the train station."
Ethan Frome,9,27,"After the successful sled, Mattie begs Ethan for another ride."
Ethan Frome,9,28,"This time, she doesn't want them to make it back up to the top of the hill."
Ethan Frome,9,29,Ethan accuses her of insanity.
Ethan Frome,9,30,She says that the real insanity will come if she is separated from Ethan.
Ethan Frome,9,31,Her sobs are intense and Ethan hold her and touches her hair.
Ethan Frome,9,32,They kiss.
Ethan Frome,9,33,The power of her suggestion to sled to the death takes him over.
Ethan Frome,9,34,His horse is crying hungrily in the distance but he beckons Mattie to the sled.
Ethan Frome,9,35,"Ethan sits in the back of the sled in the steering position, and Mattie sits in the front seat."
Ethan Frome,9,36,"Suddenly, Ethan has an idea and they switch seats."
Ethan Frome,9,37,(Now Ethan can't see to steer the sled.)
Ethan Frome,9,38,Mattie wraps her arms around him…
Ethan Frome,9,39,"Then woooooosh again, and then –"
Ethan Frome,9,40,They kiss.
Ethan Frome,9,41,And then – they crash into the big elm tree.
Ethan Frome,9,42,Ethan is trying to look at the stars.
Ethan Frome,9,43,He's suddenly very tired.
Ethan Frome,9,44,A small animal is making noise near him.
Ethan Frome,9,45,"Overwhelmed by a desire to ease the little animal's pain, he fumbles around in the snow until he feels something hair."
Ethan Frome,9,46,It's hair. Mattie's hair. He realizes that Mattie is the little animal making noise.
Ethan Frome,9,47,She says his name.
Ethan Frome,9,48,"He says her name back and tells her he though he had hit the elm, and that he needs to feed the horse…"
Ethan Frome,9,49,"(Actually, similarly to what we find at the end of the Prologue, Chapter 9 ends with an ellipsis, followed by an apostrophe, followed by forty-three ellipses. If you want to know more about this strange punctuation, visit our discussion of ""Writing Style."")"
Ethan Frome,9,50,Now on to the Epilogue.
Ethan Frome,2,0,As the youths rush out of the church basement Ethan stands back and watches.
Ethan Frome,2,1,It is a merry scene.
Ethan Frome,2,2,"He hears a woman call out to Mattie, asking her if she plans on doing a little sledding tonight."
Ethan Frome,2,3,Ethan feels his pulse suddenly race.
Ethan Frome,2,4,"Mattie declines the offer to sled, citing weather."
Ethan Frome,2,5,"Ethan is very near Mattie, though they can't see each other."
Ethan Frome,2,6,"Ethan knows Mattie will show herself soon, and that as his eyes are adjusted to the dark, he'll be able to see her clearly."
Ethan Frome,2,7,(Though she won't be able to see him.)
Ethan Frome,2,8,Shyness takes him and he hides a little more.
Ethan Frome,2,9,"Mattie's who Ethan thinks is a brighter, easier person than himself, had helped bring him out of his shell, and had helped lighten him up."
Ethan Frome,2,10,"But now Ethan feels uneasy, like back when he was in college, and ""had tried to 'jolly' the […] girls"" (2.3)."
Ethan Frome,2,11,(It's implied that Ethan wasn't too successful in his jollying.)
Ethan Frome,2,12,"Mattie, one of the last to exit the dance, looks around, maybe like she's looking for Ethan."
Ethan Frome,2,13,A man walks near her.
Ethan Frome,2,14,"The man insinuates that Mattie has been stood-up by Ethan, and says he has his dad's ""cutter"" to help rectify the situation."
Ethan Frome,2,15,He wants to use it to sled with Mattie.
Ethan Frome,2,16,Ethan is in suspense.
Ethan Frome,2,17,"Denis fetches the old cutter, but Mattie laughingly refuses his advances."
Ethan Frome,2,18,"He continues trying to persuade her, and they move beyond Ethan's range of sight and vision."
Ethan Frome,2,19,"(Finally) Ethan hears Eady drive up, and he runs to Mattie, and asks her if she thought he'd stood her up."
Ethan Frome,2,20,Mattie says she didn't; but that she thought maybe Zeena was sick.
Ethan Frome,2,21,"Ethan assures her this is not the case, and asks Mattie if she intended to walk home all by herself."
Ethan Frome,2,22,"Excitedly, she says she is not afraid of the long walk home."
Ethan Frome,2,23,Ethan asks why she didn't accept Denis' offer to drive her.
Ethan Frome,2,24,"Mattie asks how he knew about the Denis thing, laughing."
Ethan Frome,2,25,"They walk on, arm in arm, in the darkness."
Ethan Frome,2,26,Ethan desires to rub his check on Mattie's scarf.
Ethan Frome,2,27,"Instead, he asks Mattie if she'd like to make a coasting date with him."
Ethan Frome,2,28,"They decide to have a little coasting adventure the following night, provided the moon is bright."
Ethan Frome,2,29,Mattie tells Ethan that the other night Ned Hale and Ruth Varnum had almost met their deaths by accidentally crashing into an elm tree at the bottom of the slope.
Ethan Frome,2,30,"It would have been so sad, because Ned and Ruth are happy and in love."
Ethan Frome,2,31,"Ethan claims he can take that elm tree with his sled anytime, and asks if Mattie would still be afraid of the elm if he were driving the sled."
Ethan Frome,2,32,"She says she's not the fearful kind, but she says it like she doesn't care."
Ethan Frome,2,33,Mattie is a person of quickly changing moods.
Ethan Frome,2,34,"Ethan doesn't feel he has ""the right to show his feelings"" and find out hers (2.38)."
Ethan Frome,2,35,"So he's constantly trying to read every little thing she does and says to see if she likes him, and knows he likes her."
Ethan Frome,2,36,Right now he thinks she doesn't care.
Ethan Frome,2,37,When she dissed Denis Eady he felt joy.
Ethan Frome,2,38,Now he feels almost like there is no hope.
Ethan Frome,2,39,"But Ethan needs to know if she likes him, and so he tries to provoke her a little."
Ethan Frome,2,40,"He suggests that if she hadn't danced that extra dance with Denis Eady, she would have seen Ethan right away."
Ethan Frome,2,41,She doesn't try to defend herself.
Ethan Frome,2,42,He takes the more direct approach and says he imagines that the rumors are true.
Ethan Frome,2,43,She wants to know what rumors he's talking about.
Ethan Frome,2,44,"Rumors, he tells her, that she'll be leaving the Frome household soon."
Ethan Frome,2,45,"Mattie begins to freak out, and she asks Ethan if Zeena has had enough of her."
Ethan Frome,2,46,"She says she knows she's not the most excellent helper in the world, but that she could do better if Zeena would just express her needs a little more."
Ethan Frome,2,47,Mattie can tell by Zeena's face that she isn't happy with her.
Ethan Frome,2,48,She begs Ethan to tell her what Zeena needs – unless he too wants to see her gone.
Ethan Frome,2,49,Of course he doesn't want her to go. Her words soothe him. He knows she wants to stay.
Ethan Frome,2,50,They walk together quietly.
Ethan Frome,2,51,"When they hear a gunshot, and then a fox bark, Mattie snuggles up closer to Ethan and then begins to walk faster."
Ethan Frome,2,52,He asks her if she for sure doesn't want to leave the Frome house.
Ethan Frome,2,53,"She asks him where she would possibly go if she left, and Ethan thinks she might be crying, though she denies it when he asks her."
Ethan Frome,2,54,He feels her warm body next to his.
Ethan Frome,2,55,"They walk in though the gate of the Frome house, and passed ""the Frome grave-stones slanted at crazy angles through the snow"" (2.55)."
Ethan Frome,2,56,"The gravestones seem to speak to Ethan. Taunting him they seem to say, if they couldn't escape Starkfield, how could Ethan?"
Ethan Frome,2,57,Ethan has the sudden thought that he will be stuck in Starkfield until he dies.
Ethan Frome,2,58,"He knows he has to find a way to keep Mattie with him forever, and he imagines being buried with her when they both die."
Ethan Frome,2,59,When he has thoughts like that he feels happy.
Ethan Frome,2,60,Mattie trips and steadies herself by yanking on Ethan's sleeve.
Ethan Frome,2,61,He puts his arms around her for the first time.
Ethan Frome,2,62,She doesn't try to stop him. They walk together this way.
Ethan Frome,2,63,Zeena is probably in bed.
Ethan Frome,2,64,She always goes to bed right after she eats.
Ethan Frome,2,65,The windows of the house are dark.
Ethan Frome,2,66,"Ethan sees ""a dead cucumber vine"" drooping off the porch (2.58)."
Ethan Frome,2,67,Sometimes people tie a streamer to a door handle when a person formerly living in the house has died. The vine reminds Ethan of one of those.
Ethan Frome,2,68,He imagines it might be for Zeena.
Ethan Frome,2,69,"Ethan imagines her lying upstairs now, in bed, with her mouth open. Zeena doesn't have any of her own teeth left. He imagines her fake teeth, in a cup by their bed."
Ethan Frome,2,70,Zeena usually locks the door and leaves the key under the mat for Ethan and Mattie.
Ethan Frome,2,71,"Ethan and Mattie stop groping each other, and Ethan goes for the key."
Ethan Frome,2,72,Alas! The key is not to be found. A bit of a panic ensues.
Ethan Frome,2,73,Something stirs from within the house.
Ethan Frome,2,74,The door opens.
Ethan Frome,2,75,Zeena appears.
Ethan Frome,2,76,"She has a blanket wrapped around herself with one hand, and is holding onto a lamp with the other."
Ethan Frome,2,77,Her face is cast in shadows.
Ethan Frome,2,78,"She looks very different to Ethan, than ever before."
Ethan Frome,2,79,Ethan and Mattie walk into the bitterly cold kitchen.
Ethan Frome,2,80,He asks Zeena if she forgot the key.
Ethan Frome,2,81,"She says, ""No. I just felt so mean I couldn't sleep"" (2.70)"
Ethan Frome,2,82,"(These phrase is rather ambiguous, at least until we know more. Click here for some meanings of the word ""mean"" and see which ones you think apply.)"
Ethan Frome,2,83,Mattie understands this to mean that Zeena has been feeling physically ill and rushes to her offering sympathy and help.
Ethan Frome,2,84,"Zeena refuses, and gripes at her for not stomping her boots before entering the house."
Ethan Frome,2,85,Then she walks over to the stairs.
Ethan Frome,2,86,Ethan wants make sure that Mattie goes up before he does.
Ethan Frome,2,87,"Otherwise, she might seem him walking into the bedroom with Zeena, and he doesn't like the idea of this."
Ethan Frome,2,88,"So, Ethan says he's going to stay down and do a little accounting work."
Ethan Frome,2,89,Zeena says he'll get sick if he works without heat.
Ethan Frome,2,90,"(In the early 1900s, when this book is set there wasn't too much central heating going on, certainly not in Starkfield.)"
Ethan Frome,2,91,"He looks at Mattie as he walks away toward the kitchen, and she looks a little afraid."
Ethan Frome,2,92,"When she's safely headed up the stairs, he agrees with Zeena about the cold, and follows her up the stairs."
Ethan Frome,3,0,Ethan gets up early in the morning to do some wood hauling.
Ethan Frome,3,1,"The day is see-through, with a huge burning sunrise, showing glimpses of the forest in the distance."
Ethan Frome,3,2,"Zeena and Ethan hadn't talked last night in their bedroom, and both seemed to want to be as far away from each other in the bed as possible."
Ethan Frome,3,3,"In bed, Ethan had continued fantasizing about Mattie."
Ethan Frome,3,4,He wishes he had kissed her.
Ethan Frome,3,5,This was a new desire.
Ethan Frome,3,6,"When he'd seen Mattie's lips by the light of Zeena's lamp ""he felt that they were his"" (3.3)."
Ethan Frome,3,7,Ethan's head is full of Mattie's face.
Ethan Frome,3,8,He thinks about how much healthier and happier she looks than when she first came to live with them.
Ethan Frome,3,9,"There was some doubt as to whether Mattie would be able to deal with the harsh climate, and lack of company, but she never complained."
Ethan Frome,3,10,Zeena thinks Mattie doesn't complain because she knows she has nowhere else to go.
Ethan Frome,3,11,"Ethan thinks it's something deeper, and notes in his mind that Zeena doesn't have anywhere else to go either, and she complains all the time."
Ethan Frome,3,12,"Mattie father was Zeena's cousin. He recently died, leaving Mattie with nothing."
Ethan Frome,3,13,"After the funeral it became apparent that he had cheated many people in business, and had left his wife and daughter penniless."
Ethan Frome,3,14,Mattie's mother died from the news.
Ethan Frome,3,15,"Mattie was about twenty then (making her about twenty-one now), and all she had was $50 from selling her piano, and very few skills that would interest most employers."
Ethan Frome,3,16,"She had tried to learn ""stenography"" (shorthand), accounting, and clerking in a store."
Ethan Frome,3,17,All of these tasks apparently made her ill.
Ethan Frome,3,18,"The relatives that Mattie lived closest to had been cheated by her father. While they had lots of advice for Mattie, they were no willing to help her out financially."
Ethan Frome,3,19,"They decided that giving her to Zeena would allow them to get their revenge on the father, and give them the feeling of a clean conscience for having done their duty to her."
Ethan Frome,3,20,"Zeena was happy to get Mattie, because she could criticize Mattie to her hearts content, and Mattie would have to take it."
Ethan Frome,3,21,Zeena laid the criticism on thick at first. Her trick was that she did it without making a sound.
Ethan Frome,3,22,"Ethan wanted Mattie to tell Zeena to stuff it, but was really scared about what might happen if she did."
Ethan Frome,3,23,"But, summertime took care of the problem somewhat."
Ethan Frome,3,24,"The warmth helped restore Mattie to health, and since she could do more work, Zeena could spend more time worrying about her illness."
Ethan Frome,3,25,Zeena didn't criticize Mattie as much after that.
Ethan Frome,3,26,Ethan had a heavy load.
Ethan Frome,3,27,"Even though he worked all the time, neither the farm, nor the mill did well."
Ethan Frome,3,28,At least he could worry a little less about what was going on his home now that Zeena had eased up on Mattie.
Ethan Frome,3,29,"But now, Ethan fears things have changed for the worse."
Ethan Frome,3,30,"To try to keep his mind off the fear, Ethan works extra hard."
Ethan Frome,3,31,"One day he thinks that there might be problems on the home front, and wants to be around if things get ugly."
Ethan Frome,3,32,"So he goes home and finds Mattie making coffee, and Zeena sitting at the table."
Ethan Frome,3,33,Zeena is dressed for travel in a bonnet and brown-wool dress.
Ethan Frome,3,34,Her packed luggage is near.
Ethan Frome,3,35,"When questioned by Ethan, Zeena announces that she is and is headed to Bettsbridge ""to see that new doctor"" (8.49)."
Ethan Frome,3,36,"Zeena had done this a few times before, and these visits to doctors were always extremely expensive, and beyond what Ethan could afford."
Ethan Frome,3,37,"The doctors always gave her expensive medicines and cures, including some kind of strange twenty-dollar battery that Zeena never figured out how to use."
Ethan Frome,3,38,"While Zeena explains to Ethan how badly she needs to go to the doctor, Ethan calculates how long she will be gone. He reasons that there is no way she can be back to tonight."
Ethan Frome,3,39,"Ethan rapidly agrees to let Jotham Powell, the guy who works for him, drive Zeena."
Ethan Frome,3,40,"Ethan is looking at Mattie while Zeena is talking to him, but manages to tear his eyes away and face his wife."
Ethan Frome,3,41,"Zeena is only thirty-five to Ethan's twenty-eight, but ""she [is] already an old woman"" (3.18)."
Ethan Frome,3,42,"All Ethan can think about is having a night alone with Mattie, and he wonders if Mattie is thinking what he's thinking."
Ethan Frome,3,43,He needs to give Zeena some excuse as to why Jotham is driving her instead of him.
Ethan Frome,3,44,Ethan blurts out that he plans to collect some money from Andrew Hale. Andrew owes him money for wood.
Ethan Frome,3,45,"Hale isn't going to give Ethan any money, and he knows it. But, now Zeena will be counting on that money, and will find a way to spend it before he gets it."
Ethan Frome,3,46,Zeena won't be happy to hear that the funds didn't materialize.
Ethan Frome,3,47,"Not seeming to pay attention to Ethan, Zeena drinks the last of some medicine she has and then tells Mattie that if she can remove the taste of the medicine from the jar, it can be used as a container for pickles."
Ethan Frome,5,0,The meal is over.
Ethan Frome,5,1,Mattie cleans up and Ethan does the final chores.
Ethan Frome,5,2,The snow is coming down hard.
Ethan Frome,5,3,"The scene is just as he imagined it. Mattie by the fire, sewing, and he is now puffing the pipe, stretching the hard-working legs."
Ethan Frome,5,4,Ethan can't see Mattie where she's sitting so he suggests that she sit in Zeena's chair.
Ethan Frome,5,5,Actually Mattie gets up and sits in the chair.
Ethan Frome,5,6,This turns out to a bad idea. It's almost as if as if Mattie turns into Zeena.
Ethan Frome,5,7,Mattie also seems to feel uncomfortable about this arrangement and goes back to her initial position.
Ethan Frome,5,8,Ethan steals glances at her from his spot.
Ethan Frome,5,9,The cat takes over Zeena's chair.
Ethan Frome,5,10,As the quiet sets in they relax and talk.
Ethan Frome,5,11,Ethan reminds Mattie that they had a coasting date for tonight.
Ethan Frome,5,12,"Because there is no moon, they decide to postpone sledding for the following evening. Mattie is blushing furiously."
Ethan Frome,5,13,Ethan asks her if she would be too afraid to sled with him on a moonless night.
Ethan Frome,5,14,She says she's scared of nothing.
Ethan Frome,5,15,He says that he is actually afraid. Sledding on a moonless night is a good way to die.
Ethan Frome,5,16,In the dark there is no way to see the killer elm tree.
Ethan Frome,5,17,Ethan decides to tell Mattie that he saw Ruth being kissed.
Ethan Frome,5,18,"All night he'd wanted to tell her, but regret was instant. It sounded rough and rude, and triggered more intense blushing from Mattie."
Ethan Frome,5,19,She guesses quietly that he'd seen Ruth and Ned.
Ethan Frome,5,20,"Ethan had hoped he might get a kiss of his own that way, though he would have settled for the touch of her hand."
Ethan Frome,5,21,His comments seem to have had the opposite effect.
Ethan Frome,5,22,Ethan thinks he's unusually shy about these kinds of things.
Ethan Frome,5,23,When they were in the open air together they were more free than now that they're indoors.
Ethan Frome,5,24,"Mattie and Ethan talk about Ned and Ruth, and how they are planning a summer wedding."
Ethan Frome,5,25,Ethan then suggests that Mattie will be the next to wed.
Ethan Frome,5,26,She wants to know why he keeps bringing that up.
Ethan Frome,5,27,He says it's to help the reality of it sink in for him.
Ethan Frome,5,28,Could it also be because Zeena has a problem with me? Mattie wants to know.
Ethan Frome,5,29,Ethan seems irritated by her question and asks what she's talking about.
Ethan Frome,5,30,She brings up Zeena's behavior the night before.
Ethan Frome,5,31,"Well, Ethan says he can't imagine why Zeena might have a problem with Mattie."
Ethan Frome,5,32,"This isn't reassuring to Mattie, and wants to know if Zeena said anything to Ethan about her."
Ethan Frome,5,33,"Ethan tries to reassure Mattie that Zeena has not said anything. He then begs her, tenderly, to change the topic."
Ethan Frome,5,34,More blushing.
Ethan Frome,5,35,The cat jumps out of Zeena's chair in pursuit of a mouse.
Ethan Frome,5,36,On the coffee table rests the end of the piece of cloth Mattie is sewing.
Ethan Frome,5,37,Ethan touches it and they seem to have some kind of psychic communication through the cloth.
Ethan Frome,5,38,An image of Zeena back in her chair the next day captures Ethan.
Ethan Frome,5,39,Mattie seems to pick up his anxiety over this.
Ethan Frome,5,40,"So Ethan, in a daze, kisses the end of the piece of cloth, with his eyes closed."
Ethan Frome,5,41,When he opens his eyes Mattie is rolling up the piece of cloth and preparing to leave the room.
Ethan Frome,5,42,Together they bring the geranium flowers away from the windows so they don't get frozen in the night.
Ethan Frome,5,43,"Ethan's candle in her hand, Mattie goes up stairs, telling him good night."
Ethan Frome,5,44,"The sound of Mattie's door closing reminds Ethan that ""he had not even touched her hand"" (5.41)."
Ethan Frome,4,0,"Zeena takes off while Mattie is doing the dishes and then Ethan leaves, too."
Ethan Frome,4,1,He and Mattie exchange friendly yet casual good-byes.
Ethan Frome,4,2,"The kitchen is warm and cozy, complete with potted geraniums and a sleeping cat."
Ethan Frome,4,3,"Ethan wants to stay, but even more he wants to get his work done so he can be back before the night comes."
Ethan Frome,4,4,He thinks of Mattie while he works.
Ethan Frome,4,5,"Mattie doesn't keep the kind of ultra-clean kitchen his mother had, but makes the place look friendly."
Ethan Frome,4,6,"In his mind, he imagines their evening together. He sees them by the fire, he smoking his pipe, Mattie laughing and talking."
Ethan Frome,4,7,It will be their first time alone. Ever.
Ethan Frome,4,8,"He lets himself believe everything is OK with Zeena now, and begins to feel better about life."
Ethan Frome,4,9,"For once, he even whistles while he works."
Ethan Frome,4,10,"Ethan loves to see people being happy, but is rarely happy himself."
Ethan Frome,4,11,At school he loved it when the guys were friendly with him.
Ethan Frome,4,12,He has become more and more silent with each passing year.
Ethan Frome,4,13,"After his dad died, leaving Ethan to take care of the mill, the farm, and his mother, Ethan didn't have time to hang out with young people."
Ethan Frome,4,14,His mother stopped talking soon after.
Ethan Frome,4,15,"When begged by Ethan to speak, she would tell him that due to the loudness of the voices in the yard, she couldn't hear what he was saying."
Ethan Frome,4,16,"When she was near the end, Ethan's cousin Zenobia came to help him care for the old woman."
Ethan Frome,4,17,(Wait a minute. Zeena and Mattie are cousins. Zeena and Ethan are cousins. But it doesn't look like Mattie and Ethan are cousins. Must be different sides of the family.)
Ethan Frome,4,18,Ethan was so starved for the sound of another human's voice that Zeena sounded awesome to him.
Ethan Frome,4,19,"He thought he would have gone insane if she hadn't come, and was very grateful to her."
Ethan Frome,4,20,She was also really good and kind to his mother.
Ethan Frome,4,21,"Zeena was preparing to leave town after the funeral, but he stopped her, and asked that she remain with him in Starkfield."
Ethan Frome,4,22,"Ethan thinks that if his mother had died in summer or spring instead of the desolate winter, he probably would never have gotten himself in the mess (i.e., he never would have married Zeena)."
Ethan Frome,4,23,Zeena had agreed to move away from Starkfield with Ethan.
Ethan Frome,4,24,The initial plan was to sell the farm and mill and move to a city.
Ethan Frome,4,25,"Ethan loved nature, but not farming. Engineering was what he planned to study."
Ethan Frome,4,26,He thought that Zeena was an intelligent person who would help him build a nice life – away from Starkfield.
Ethan Frome,4,27,"Zeena's home town was bigger than Starkfield, and closer to passing trains, so she didn't want to live in the middle of nowhere either."
Ethan Frome,4,28,"But times were hard, and the farm didn't sell."
Ethan Frome,4,29,"In the meantime, Ethan found out that Zeena would never move."
Ethan Frome,4,30,"She thought she was better than the people in Starkfield, but couldn't handle the idea of living in a place where people might look down on her."
Ethan Frome,4,31,This meant that pretty much anywhere but Starkfield was out of the question.
Ethan Frome,4,32,"They had been married about a year when Zeena changed from a person in seemingly perfect heath, into a person who was always sick."
Ethan Frome,4,33,"Lots of people in Starkfield are obsessed with illness, but Zeena has always been an extreme case."
Ethan Frome,4,34,"The she stopped talking, too. Zeena claimed that talking to Ethan was pointless because he didn't pay attention to the things she said."
Ethan Frome,4,35,There was truth in that.
Ethan Frome,4,36,Zeena was all nagging and complaining.
Ethan Frome,4,37,Sometimes Ethan wonders if Zeena was having psychological problems similar to his mother's. Other times he thinks that she's quietly planning some who-knows-what kind of deed.
Ethan Frome,4,38,He feels better now though.
Ethan Frome,4,39,"If Zeena is her old self, going to expensive doctors and all that, then nothing must be the matter."
Ethan Frome,4,40,The only thing bugging him was the lie about money he told to Zeena.
Ethan Frome,4,41,So he decides to see if he can collect some money from Andrew Hale.
Ethan Frome,4,42,"Ethan puts the question to him nonchalantly, and Hale refuses good-naturedly."
Ethan Frome,4,43,"He says he's short because he's setting up a house for his son Ned and his bride to be, Ruth Varnum."
Ethan Frome,4,44,"When asked if he needs it badly, Ethan is too ashamed to admit it, and goes away empty handed."
Ethan Frome,4,45,"He takes care of some other business, and he thinks about how long his seven years of marriage to Zeena has seemed."
Ethan Frome,4,46,"(By the way, that means Ethan was about twenty-one, and Zeena about twenty-eight, when they got married.)"
Ethan Frome,4,47,"Denis Eady drives by with his dad's cutter. Ethan says hi to Denis, and wonders if he could be going to see Mattie."
Ethan Frome,4,48,"Ashamed of his jealousy, Ethan walks on and surprises Ned and Ruth, who are kissing in front of the Varnum house, in the same place where he and Mattie had talked last night."
Ethan Frome,4,49,It makes him feel happy to have seen lovers.
Ethan Frome,4,50,He wishes that he and Mattie didn't have to love in secret.
Ethan Frome,4,51,"On the long trek home Ethan keeps an ear out for Denis Eady's horse, still wondering if the man had been visiting Mattie."
Ethan Frome,4,52,"As he nears the farm he sees that Mattie's bedroom light is on, and he imagines her dressing for the evening meal as she always did, much to Zeena's mocking displeasure."
Ethan Frome,4,53,He passes the graves again and looks at the one that belongs to an ancestor that has his same name.
Ethan Frome,4,54,"The stone says that the other Ethan Frome and his wife, Endurance, were married for fifty-years, and buried together."
Ethan Frome,4,55,He wonders if he would and Zeena would be married for fifty-years and be buried together.
Ethan Frome,4,56,Ethan looks in the barn and has about convinced himself he'll find Denis horse there.
Ethan Frome,4,57,But the horse is not there and all is well. He heads to the house.
Ethan Frome,4,58,To his astonishment the kitchen door is locked.
Ethan Frome,4,59,"Well, of course Mattie would want the door locked when she's here, alone on this isolated farm."
Ethan Frome,4,60,He calls to Mattie.
Ethan Frome,4,61,"It's like a replay of the night before, except this time Mattie is coming down the stairs with the lantern instead of Zeena."
Ethan Frome,4,62,"She's dressed in her regular dress, but has braided a ribbon into her hair that adds a touch of elegance that charms Ethan."
Ethan Frome,4,63,"The table is set for their evening meal of fresh doughnuts, blueberries, and pickles."
Ethan Frome,4,64,Mattie has put the pickles in a pretty red serving dish.
Ethan Frome,4,65,"The fire burns, and the cat yawns."
Ethan Frome,4,66,Ethan feels wonderful and almost too happy.
Ethan Frome,4,67,"The cat brushes Mattie's leg, almost tripping her."
Ethan Frome,4,68,She looks so happy and Ethan can't quite believe it's just because of him.
Ethan Frome,4,69,Jealousy comes over him again.
Ethan Frome,4,70,"Ethan asks Mattie if anybody come by while he was out working. She says that yes, someone had come."
Ethan Frome,4,71,A little harshly he asks her who. A little angrily she tells him that Jotham Powell came by.
Ethan Frome,4,72,Ethan asks if Jotham got Zeena safely to where she needed to be.
Ethan Frome,4,73,"Mattie says yes, but speaking of Zeena's name makes them both uneasy and they head to the table."
Ethan Frome,4,74,"The cat decides to join them, taking Zeena's chair."
Ethan Frome,4,75,"As they somewhat awkwardly dine together, the cat moves stealthily toward the nearby milk jug."
Ethan Frome,4,76,Ethan and Mattie both reach for said milk jug and their hands meet on the handle.
Ethan Frome,4,77,Ethan's hand is now on top of Mattie's.
Ethan Frome,4,78,"The cat backs off, and boom, knocks down the pickle dish onto the floor."
Ethan Frome,4,79,Mattie begins to panic.
Ethan Frome,4,80,Ethan says he can easily replace the item.
Ethan Frome,4,81,"Mattie says it's irreplaceable, that it was a wedding gift, and was never supposed to be used."
Ethan Frome,4,82,"Ethan begs her not to cry, and promises to make everything better."
Ethan Frome,4,83,"He reassembles the dish in its proper place, and plans to get glue and glue it before Zeena returns."
Ethan Frome,4,84,"Crisis somewhat averted, they settle back down."
Ethan Frome,4,85,"Mattie is beaming, and Ethan feels powerful and in control."
Ethan Frome,1,0,"(From here until the Epilogue, the story is told in the third person, but limited to Ethan's perspective.)"
Ethan Frome,1,1,"There is deep snow on the ground, and the sky is full of stars, and the lights seeping from the windows of the church basement are yellow."
Ethan Frome,1,2,"""Young Ethan Frome"" is rapidly clicking along the street toward it."
Ethan Frome,1,3,"There is no breeze, and the cold air is hardly seems cold, as if there was no atmosphere."
Ethan Frome,1,4,"Ethan thinks, ""It's like being in an exhausted receiver"" (1.3)."
Ethan Frome,1,5,"(""Exhausted receiver"" is a term in physics used to describe something that once received air, but such air has been let out (or exhausted), creating a vacuum. Think of a bicycle pump.)"
Ethan Frome,1,6,"Several years earlier Ethan had studied physics in college for about a year, and remembered things about it now and again."
Ethan Frome,1,7,"When his dad died, and everything started to go bad, Ethan had to stop school."
Ethan Frome,1,8,Ethan arrives at the church and looks around.
Ethan Frome,1,9,He sees Corbury Road.
Ethan Frome,1,10,"Kids love to sled down the hill nearby, though on this night there is no sledding, probably because all the youngsters are in the church basement at the dance."
Ethan Frome,1,11,Now Ethan is peeping in the window of the church basement.
Ethan Frome,1,12,"The scene looks hot, especially in contrast to the still cold of the night."
Ethan Frome,1,13,"The dance is over. The music has stopped, and the attendees begin leaving."
Ethan Frome,1,14,But wait….
Ethan Frome,1,15,"A dark haired man hops and skips onto the dance floor, and claps his hands."
Ethan Frome,1,16,The music begins anew.
Ethan Frome,1,17,"The man takes the hand of pretty, young lass."
Ethan Frome,1,18,"She and the man begin to dance while the band plays a ""Virginia reel."""
Ethan Frome,1,19,"Ethan's heart is pounding. He was trying to see the face of the dancing girl, and is irritated that she was dancing with the fiery Irish youth."
Ethan Frome,1,20,"Still, he watches her dance, noting that the Irish youth in question is Denis Eady, son of Michael, the grocer. This guy Denis looks like he thinks he owns the girl."
Ethan Frome,1,21,"Ethan doesn't like Denis, and can't imagine how the girl doesn't notice that he's a creep."
Ethan Frome,1,22,"The girl is Mattie Silver, Ethan's wife's cousin."
Ethan Frome,1,23,Ethan came to pick her up whenever she came to town in the evenings.
Ethan Frome,1,24,"Both of Mattie's parents had died and she had nowhere to go, so she had come to live with the Fromes. She helps care for the house, and for Zeena (Ethan's wife)."
Ethan Frome,1,25,"Since they didn't pay her (other than room and board) Zeena, thought that Mattie should get some entertainment and suggested she participate in the Starkfield social party scene."
Ethan Frome,1,26,"Ethan wasn't thrilled with this at first, as it meant that he would have to walk two more miles than usual to pick her up."
Ethan Frome,1,27,"But now, he wishes that Mattie would party every night."
Ethan Frome,1,28,"Mattie has lived with the Fromes for about a year, and Ethan's favorite thing is to be near her. His favorite way to be near her is walking, arms locked together, back from town on these nights."
Ethan Frome,1,29,"He'd liked Mattie right away, and hoped she would breath some life into the house."
Ethan Frome,1,30,"In fact, she is smart, and she and Ethan had excellent conversations together, mostly about nature."
Ethan Frome,1,31,"Ethan is into natural beauty, and Mattie shared this love."
Ethan Frome,1,32,"He could point out the constellations to her, and talk to her about the history of the earth."
Ethan Frome,1,33,"As he watches her dancing, he is remembering their times together, and now thinking that she must have been humoring all along."
Ethan Frome,1,34,He thinks he's silly to think that a girl like Mattie would really be interested in him.
Ethan Frome,1,35,"Since Ethan is only light and happy when around Mattie, it strikes him that she can be light and happy without him."
Ethan Frome,1,36,He notices also that the way she laughs with him is the same way she laughs when with this Denis Eady character.
Ethan Frome,1,37,"This bums him out, and brings his fears to mind."
Ethan Frome,1,38,"Though Zeena had never seemed jealous of Mattie, lately, she had been finding constant fault with the girl."
Ethan Frome,1,39,"Zeena had always had health issues, and Mattie probably wasn't the strongest and best helper in the word."
Ethan Frome,1,40,"She was a decent housekeeper, but one could tell her heart wasn't quite in it, and she was prone to dreaminess."
Ethan Frome,1,41,"Ethan thought that if she had a house of her own, her inner housewife would come emerge."
Ethan Frome,1,42,"For now, Ethan helps Mattie with the chores."
Ethan Frome,1,43,Once Zeena caught him churning butter and gave him a funky look.
Ethan Frome,1,44,"Zeena has also been whining more lately, and hinting that Mattie might be leaving soon, perhaps to get married, and that she would need somebody new, though they couldn't afford it."
Ethan Frome,1,45,Ethan remembers a conversation he just had with Zeena about Mattie.
Ethan Frome,1,46,Ethan had assured Zeena that Mattie would never abandon her.
Ethan Frome,1,47,Zeena had said she didn't want to get in between Mattie's happiness with Denis Eady.
Ethan Frome,1,48,"This had shocked Ethan, who was shaving at the moment."
Ethan Frome,1,49,He insisted (casually) that no such romance was budding.
Ethan Frome,1,50,"Zeena wanted to continue the conversation, but Ethan claims he's late to pick up Mattie."
Ethan Frome,1,51,"This doesn't please Zeena, and she comments on a pattern of lateness she's noticed in Ethan, and a pattern of shaving every morning."
Ethan Frome,1,52,This shocked him even more than the Denis Eady business.
Ethan Frome,1,53,He hadn't thought that she noticed this new need to shave that happened to coincide with Mattie's moving in with them.
Ethan Frome,1,54,"Zeena had always been like that though, noticing something he thought she hadn't noticed, and then bringing it up slyly when he was off-guard."
Ethan Frome,1,55,"But lately, he'd been to busy dreaming of Mattie Silver to worry much about Zeena oppression."
Ethan Frome,1,56,"As Ethan watches Mattie and Denis dancing, all the little hints that Zeena had been giving about Mattie and Denis came together."
Ethan Frome,0,0,"The prologue of Ethan Frome is told in the first person by a nameless man. We call him ""him,"" or ""the narrator."" (See ""Narrator Point of View"" for more on this.)"
Ethan Frome,0,1,"The novella begins with the narrator telling us that he learned this story in pieces from a variety of sources, each with a different version."
Ethan Frome,0,2,"If you've ever been to Starkfield, Massachusetts you've probably seen the post office, and if you've seen the post office, you could have seen Ethan Frome ride up on his horse, who, like Ethan, has a bent spine."
Ethan Frome,0,3,"You would also see Ethan dismount, and then limp to the building."
Ethan Frome,0,4,"That was the scene the first time the narrator saw Ethan, and the narrator was shocked by the way Ethan looked."
Ethan Frome,0,5,Ethan was the most interesting character in Starkfield.
Ethan Frome,0,6,It's not just because Ethan was super-tall – many Starkfielders are tall.
Ethan Frome,0,7,"Nope, it's because he had swagger – even with the severe limp, and disfiguration of one side of his body."
Ethan Frome,0,8,"Ethan's face had a grim, aged look, and the narrator was shocked to hear he was only fifty-two years old."
Ethan Frome,0,9,"The narrator learned Ethan's age from Harmon Gow, an ex stage-coach driver who knew all the stories of all the families in the area."
Ethan Frome,0,10,"Harmon Gow, the town gossip, told the narrator that Ethan had looked ancient ever since an accident that occurred 24 years ago."
Ethan Frome,0,11,"(Hmm…If Ethan was 52 when seen at the post office, and was in an accident 24 years ago, then he was 28 when he was hurt.)"
Ethan Frome,0,12,"The accident left Ethan with a deep, red scar across his forehead, and rendered his left side practically useless."
Ethan Frome,0,13,"Ethan usually drove up to the post office near midday, which happened to be when the narrator checked his own mail."
Ethan Frome,0,14,This gives the narrator the opportunity to notice that Ethan doesn't get much mail other than the local paper.
Ethan Frome,0,15,Occasionally Ethan would pick up packages for Mrs. Zenobia – or Mrs. Zeena – Frome.
Ethan Frome,0,16,The narrator could tell by their labels that Zeena's packages contained various types of patent medicine.
Ethan Frome,0,17,All the townspeople knew Ethan and spoke to him when they saw him.
Ethan Frome,0,18,"Otherwise, they mostly let him alone."
Ethan Frome,0,19,Harmon told the narrator that Ethan's accident would have left many men dead.
Ethan Frome,0,20,"Apparently, Ethan came from a line of rugged and hearty people, and would probably live to see his hundredth year."
Ethan Frome,0,21,This freaks out the narrator.
Ethan Frome,0,22,"He notes that Ethan looked ""as if he was dead and in hell now."""
Ethan Frome,0,23,Harmon blames this on the starkness of Starkfield winters. Smart men don't usually stick around to freeze away their lives in this town.
Ethan Frome,0,24,The narrator can't understand why Ethan stayed in such conditions.
Ethan Frome,0,25,"It seems that Ethan was stuck taking care of first his father, then his mother, and then his wife."
Ethan Frome,0,26,The narrator guessed that this was in pre-accident days.
Ethan Frome,0,27,"When the narrator was in Starkfield, due to spread of travel, communication technologies, and recreational and entertainment options, it wasn't such a brutal place as back when Ethan was young."
Ethan Frome,0,28,"Still, when the depths of winter set in, the narrator could see how it could break down any man."
Ethan Frome,0,29,"The narrator happens to be in Starkfield en route to a job at a power company, in nearby Corbury Junction, but a strike was holding him up from getting the job finished."
Ethan Frome,0,30,"At first the narrator was upset by being stuck, but became impressed with the liveliness of the environment, and, by contrast, the deadness of the people who lived in it."
Ethan Frome,0,31,"During the winter, the narrator had a room at the home of the widowed Mrs. Ned Hale and her mother."
Ethan Frome,0,32,"Before she was married her name was Ruth Varnum, and she was the daughter of a wealthy attorney."
Ethan Frome,0,33,"The ladies are no longer wealthy, but still dignified."
Ethan Frome,0,34,"Ruth originally told the narrator stories about Starkfield, but in a very detached way. Because she was more educated than most Starkfield townspeople, there was a wedge between them."
Ethan Frome,0,35,"In other words, she looked down on them."
Ethan Frome,0,36,"On the subject of Ethan Frome, though, she was much more emotional. She wouldn't talk about it to the narrator when pressed."
Ethan Frome,0,37,"So, he asked Harmon why Ruth would clam up about the topic of Ethan Frome."
Ethan Frome,0,38,"Harmon told him that Ruth was the first person to see the people involved in the accident, after the accident."
Ethan Frome,0,39,"Ruth, who was then engaged to Ned Hale, was friends with Ethan and the other person in the accident."
Ethan Frome,0,40,"In any case, the narrator couldn't get a satisfactory version of events, and might have let it go if he hadn't happened to meet Ethan."
Ethan Frome,0,41,"Denis Eady, a wealthy, Irish, grocery store owner had been giving the narrator a horse ride to the train station every day."
Ethan Frome,0,42,"But, about mid-winter there was an epidemic of horse disease, and the narrator couldn't get where he needed to go."
Ethan Frome,0,43,"Harmon suggested he try to hire Ethan Frome, who was pretty low on resources."
Ethan Frome,0,44,"The Frome farm never prospered, but before Ethan was injured, the farm managed to yield a meager living."
Ethan Frome,0,45,"First Ethan's father was injured by a farm animal, and then his mother began having mental problems."
Ethan Frome,0,46,"Ethan's wife, Zeena was sort of an unofficial nurse in the area."
Ethan Frome,0,47,"In short, Ethan was always in the middle of illness and problems."
Ethan Frome,0,48,"For about a week Ethan drove the narrator to Corbury Flats, and was there in the evening to drive him back to Starkfield."
Ethan Frome,0,49,"Ethan didn't talk during the drives, unless it was to briefly answer a question from the narrator."
Ethan Frome,0,50,Ethan seemed to be made of the same stuff as the landscape: freezing cold sadness.
Ethan Frome,0,51,All Ethan's warmth was buried deep inside him.
Ethan Frome,0,52,But he wasn't mean or grumpy.
Ethan Frome,0,53,"The narrator attributes his grim aspect to not only the accident, but (again) to ""many Starkfield winters"" (Prologue.29)."
Ethan Frome,0,54,A couple of time the narrator and Ethan were able to cross the distance between them and talk.
Ethan Frome,0,55,The first time was when the narrator was telling Ethan about an engineering job he had in Florida.
Ethan Frome,0,56,"Ethan tells him that he, too, has seen Florida."
Ethan Frome,0,57,"The second time the two men talked was when the narrator, after being dropped at the train station by Ethan, noticed that his science magazine, featuring articles on biochemistry was missing."
Ethan Frome,0,58,"When Ethan picked him up, he gave him the magazine, telling him it was left in the buggy."
Ethan Frome,0,59,"Ethan must have looked through it, because he expressed amazement over it, suggesting to the narrator that he liked to study science in the past."
Ethan Frome,0,60,"In turn, the narrator offered to give him the magazine, and Ethan accepted."
Ethan Frome,0,61,The narrator hoped this might thaw the ice between them and lead to further conversations.
Ethan Frome,0,62,Ethan's genuine interest in science revealed that there might be a difference between what Ethan must be inside and how he lives his life.
Ethan Frome,0,63,Further conversations were not to be.
Ethan Frome,0,64,"Ethan didn't bring up the book, and the narrator couldn't pry any more out of Ethan."
Ethan Frome,0,65,After a week of these drives the narrator woke to a deep snow.
Ethan Frome,0,66,The narrator was sure Ethan would show. He wasn't the kind of man to let weather keep him from a job.
Ethan Frome,0,67,"But, he didn't expect Ethan to drive him all the way to Corbury Junction since the train wasn't running. But Ethan made the drive."
Ethan Frome,0,68,"The narrator, who needed to work there, expressed his major gratitude."
Ethan Frome,0,69,"They had to drive ten miles through the storm, and they passed Ethan's sawmill and house on the way."
Ethan Frome,0,70,The Frome house looked pretty grim.
Ethan Frome,0,71,Ethan told the narrator that when his father was alive the house was larger.
Ethan Frome,0,72,"But, they had to remove the ""L."""
Ethan Frome,0,73,"(The narrator explained that the ""L"" is a building that connects the house with the barns and other outbuildings so the farmer can tend to the animals when the weather is bad without going outside. This ""L"" was very important to the New England home, and Ethan seemed sad talking about the loss of his ""L."")"
Ethan Frome,0,74,"It isn't made clear exactly why Ethan had to give up his ""L,"" but it was probably for economic reasons. Maybe he needed to sell the material it was made of, or maybe it was too expensive to maintain."
Ethan Frome,0,75,"Ethan explained that the town economy was poor because the train began running, and did not stop in Starkfield."
Ethan Frome,0,76,"With no train, there were no people spend money in Starkfield."
Ethan Frome,0,77,It seemed to the narrator that by showing him the house Ethan had made him a confidante and no longer needed to hide.
Ethan Frome,0,78,Ethan told the narrator that his mother's sanity started to slip when the train stopped coming through.
Ethan Frome,0,79,"She was housebound because of her rheumatism, and when the train stopped coming through, she was unbearably isolated, and couldn't quite understand what had happened."
Ethan Frome,0,80,"Soon, the two men passed the house, and after some time, made it to the powerhouse."
Ethan Frome,0,81,"They managed to get back as well, and Ethan invited the narrator to stay the night, as further travel would be unwise."
Ethan Frome,0,82,When they got in the hall the narrator heard the voice of a woman. She was talking on and on in an argumentative tone.
Ethan Frome,0,83,"Ethan invited the narrator in, and the voice stopped."
Ethan Frome,0,84,"And then, that very dark and snowy night, the narrator ""found the clue to Ethan Frome and began to put together this vision of the his story…"" (Prologue.65)."
Ethan Frome,0,85,"(There are actually fifty ""…""s or ""ellipses"" at the end of the prologue. If these intrigue you, check out our discussion of Ethan Frome's ""Writing Style."")"
Ethan Frome,6,0,"Jotham has breakfast with Mattie and Ethan, and Ethan tries to hide his joy at being in love by pretending to ignore Mattie."
Ethan Frome,6,1,"They'd had no physical contact, but a newer, fresher kind of life is now imaginable."
Ethan Frome,6,2,"In the light of day, Ethan is glad things didn't move to the physical level."
Ethan Frome,6,3,"He plans his heavy work day, and asks Jotham to pick up Zeena after the noon meal."
Ethan Frome,6,4,A few precious moments are left for Mattie and Ethan to have some alone-time.
Ethan Frome,6,5,Mattie is steamy from doing dishes.
Ethan Frome,6,6,This might be there last time they are ever alone together Ethan wants to tell her.
Ethan Frome,6,7,Instead he puts some chewing tobacco in his mouth.
Ethan Frome,6,8,He'll try to be home for lunch.
Ethan Frome,6,9,On his way out he hears that her whistle while she works.
Ethan Frome,6,10,"Everything goes wrong for Ethan during the day, and he doesn't have time to get the glue."
Ethan Frome,6,11,"After a quick bite with Jotham and Mattie (with no alone-time), Ethan sets off for the glue."
Ethan Frome,6,12,With difficulty he finds the only tube of glue in town and races back home to glue the dish.
Ethan Frome,6,13,"Through the sleet he races, trying to get home before Zeena."
Ethan Frome,6,14,"The horse is still absent from the stable when Ethan arrives on the scene. He enters the kitchen, finds Mattie alone, and excitedly presents her with the glue."
Ethan Frome,6,15,Mattie gives him the horrible news.
Ethan Frome,6,16,Zeena is already home.
Ethan Frome,6,17,"Jotham had driven the horse to another location, which is why it's absent from the barn."
Ethan Frome,6,18,Mattie doesn't know how Zeena is because she didn't talk to her. Zeena is now in her room
Ethan Frome,6,19,"Ethan tries to soothe her, promising to fix the dish on the sly in the night."
Ethan Frome,6,20,Soon Jotham shows up.
Ethan Frome,6,21,Ethan invites him to dinner but he declines.
Ethan Frome,6,22,Maybe Zeena was unhappy about something and had abused him on the ride.
Ethan Frome,6,23,"Back in the kitchen the scene is similar to the way it was last night: the fire, the sleeping cat, the doughnuts are all there as they were before."
Ethan Frome,6,24,"As last night, Mattie suggests that they eat."
Ethan Frome,7,0,Ethan finds Zeena in the bedroom and asks if she wants to come eat.
Ethan Frome,7,1,She says she isn't hungry.
Ethan Frome,7,2,"Ethan knows that she always says this, and then always gets up and eats shortly thereafter."
Ethan Frome,7,3,Now Zeena tells him that she is very sick.
Ethan Frome,7,4,Ethan says he hopes she isn't. She implies that she might be dying.
Ethan Frome,7,5,"Ethan pities her in her seeming loneliness, but is rather shocked and begins to call into question the credibility of the doctor she must have consulted with."
Ethan Frome,7,6,Zeena defends Dr Buck.
Ethan Frome,7,7,"Apparently Dr Buck thinks Zeena needs to have a housekeeper, so that she can do nothing but rest all the time. Apparently she has already found one."
Ethan Frome,7,8,"Aha, thinks Ethan. The doctor thing is all a cheap plot to tear Mattie away from him."
Ethan Frome,7,9,He asks Zeena if the doctor also told her how they would pay for this new employee.
Ethan Frome,7,10,"She tells him that she was too embarrassed to tell the doctor that Ethan didn't care about her health, even though she lost her own health taking care of Ethan's mother."
Ethan Frome,7,11,This is a new one on Ethan.
Ethan Frome,7,12,Zeena then suggests that Ethan owed it to her to marry her after she helped with his mother.
Ethan Frome,7,13,"Ethan is shocked by the gruesome scene, and ashamed of his own role in it."
Ethan Frome,7,14,He lights the candle.
Ethan Frome,7,15,This is his first real fight with Zeena.
Ethan Frome,7,16,"Ethan reminds Zeena that he doesn't have money to hire anyone else, and tells her she'll have to unhire the new hire."
Ethan Frome,7,17,Zeena tells Ethan that the doctor told her that if she doesn't stop working so hard she will die.
Ethan Frome,7,18,"Appalled, Ethan almost blurts out what he thinks of that idea."
Ethan Frome,7,19,"Instead, he checks himself and promises to do the extra work himself, and she can be free of all such duties."
Ethan Frome,7,20,Now Zeena reminds him that he already has more work than he can take.
Ethan Frome,7,21,"She makes a crack about his Fromes being poor, and then goes in for the kill – where's the fifty bucks from Andrew Hale?"
Ethan Frome,7,22,Ethan tells her the truth; Andrew will pay him in three months.
Ethan Frome,7,23,Zeena reminds him of his lie from the day before.
Ethan Frome,7,24,"Not being a good liar, Ethan basically abandons the ruse, and tells Zeena to forget the fifty for the time being."
Ethan Frome,7,25,Zeena says she had the fifty in mind when she employed the new maid.
Ethan Frome,7,26,"Ethan apologizes for being poor, and promises to care for her, with Mattie's help of course."
Ethan Frome,7,27,This isn't quite what Zeena has in mind for Mattie.
Ethan Frome,7,28,She tells Ethan that things will be less tight without the expense of having Mattie around.
Ethan Frome,7,29,Ethan is completely caught off guard at this last comment.
Ethan Frome,7,30,"Tickled, Zeena begins to laugh at him."
Ethan Frome,7,31,She says that now she understands why Ethan was worried about the money – he must have thought she planned to have the new maid in addition to Mattie.
Ethan Frome,7,32,"Confused, Ethan reminds Zeena that Mattie isn't an employee. She's family."
Ethan Frome,7,33,"Zeena begs to differ. She explains that Mattie is just a burden, and that she (Zeena) is now done with her share of the charity."
Ethan Frome,7,34,She wants to pass the burden on to someone else.
Ethan Frome,7,35,"Then, Mattie knocks on the door and in a happy voice reminds them that dinner is ready."
Ethan Frome,7,36,Through the door Zeena tells her she won't be dining.
Ethan Frome,7,37,"Panicking, Mattie asks if she's OK, if there's anything she needs."
Ethan Frome,7,38,"Ethan speaks up, and asks Mattie to wait downstairs. He tries to get Zeena to change her mind about Mattie, but Zeena's mind is set."
Ethan Frome,7,39,"Mattie is supposed to leave the very next day, to make room for the new person."
Ethan Frome,7,40,"Now Ethan hates Zeena. She's not the sick, weak, miserable person he thought."
Ethan Frome,7,41,"No, Zeena is evil, sucking him dry, robbing him of all the good in life."
Ethan Frome,7,42,"He is on the verge of punching, but instead asks her weirdly if she's not coming down to eat."
Ethan Frome,7,43,Zeena says she'll have a little rest instead.
Ethan Frome,7,44,Back in the kitchen Ethan and Mattie are trying to enjoy their last dinner.
Ethan Frome,7,45,But Ethan can't eat.
Ethan Frome,7,46,"Mattie begs him to tell her what the matter is,"
Ethan Frome,7,47,He blurts it out. Mattie can't believe she's to be booted out.
Ethan Frome,7,48,She wants to know if Zeena is upset with her about something.
Ethan Frome,7,49,"Oh no, Ethan tells her. It's like this every time she gets a new doctor."
Ethan Frome,7,50,Mattie knows that Zeena is a person who means what she says.
Ethan Frome,7,51,She tries to console Ethan.
Ethan Frome,7,52,"Desperately, he asks her if she has someplace to go."
Ethan Frome,7,53,Mattie's future is grim. None of her relatives like her and he knows what happens to women who try to make their ways alone in the cities.
Ethan Frome,7,54,"Ethan jumps up and tells Mattie that she can't go, and that he's not going to let Zeena have her way this time."
Ethan Frome,7,55,"Zeena is in the kitchen now, whining that the doctor said she should eat well."
Ethan Frome,7,56,"She fixes her false teeth and digs in, petting the cat and feeding it scraps."
Ethan Frome,7,57,"Ethan is in shock, but Mattie tries to make small talk with Zeena, who criticizes her cooking."
Ethan Frome,7,58,Now Zeena needs some medicine for the heartburn it has given her.
Ethan Frome,7,59,"Concerned, Mattie offers to get some."
Ethan Frome,7,60,Zeena says the medicines are in a secret place that Mattie doesn't have access to.
Ethan Frome,7,61,"Ethan decides to step out for a bit of mountain air, but before he gets outside Zeena comes back from looking for the medicine."
Ethan Frome,7,62,She doesn't look like a happy camper.
Ethan Frome,7,63,"She found the broken pickle dish, and wants to know how this came happened."
Ethan Frome,7,64,Zeena has never used the pickle dish – their wedding gift.
Ethan Frome,7,65,Ethan blames the cat.
Ethan Frome,7,66,Zeena says that cat must be pretty smart to try to cover up its crime.
Ethan Frome,7,67,"Mattie rushes to Ethan's defense, admitting that she had wanted to make the table look nice for dinner the night before."
Ethan Frome,7,68,This makes things even worse.
Ethan Frome,7,69,Zeena says Mattie purposely took from her most prized possession – the pickle dish – from her.
Ethan Frome,7,70,"Then she begins to cry, but quickly hardens again."
Ethan Frome,7,71,"If only she had listened to the people in town, things wouldn't have gone this far."
Ethan Frome,7,72,"Zeena exits, carrying out the glass pieces like ""a dead body"" (7.127)."
The Piazza Tales,10,0,"And hey, here's another quote from Spenser. The comparison with the Faerie Queene just never gets old for Melville."
The Piazza Tales,10,1,"Charles's Isle is near Barrington Isle. And for once, Melville has an actual story to tell, sort of."
The Piazza Tales,10,2,"Three cheers for an actual story! Hip, hip, hooray!"
The Piazza Tales,10,3,"It's not that much of a story, but Shmoop is desperate, and will take what Shmoop can get."
The Piazza Tales,10,4,"During Peru's independence struggle from Spain, there was one Creole guy who fought with Peru."
The Piazza Tales,10,5,"A Creole is someone who has both European and Indian ancestry, by the by."
The Piazza Tales,10,6,"Anyway, the Creole guy fought for Peru for money, but at the end of the revolution, they didn't have money to pay him, so they gave him Charles's Island, which was relatively inhabitable, and quite large."
The Piazza Tales,10,7,"The Creole guy determined to rule the island, and brought some settlers over to be his subjects."
The Piazza Tales,10,8,To keep order he brought some large dogs with him.
The Piazza Tales,10,9,"Things quickly went to pot, though; the subjects weren't keen on being ruled by the Creole and his dogs, so the Creole guy shot some of them (the subjects, not the dogs.)"
The Piazza Tales,10,10,"What with the shooting people and the not being many there to begin with, the population wasn't very great."
The Piazza Tales,10,11,"So the Creole guy replenished it by inducing people from whalers to abandon their posts, and join his not so very merry band."
The Piazza Tales,10,12,"He's sneaky, our hero."
The Piazza Tales,10,13,"But the folks who leave the whalers are sneaky too, and eventually there's a revolt and the Creole is driven away, back to Peru in exile."
The Piazza Tales,10,14,"He presumably hoped to hear that his island was falling apart without him, and it sort of was."
The Piazza Tales,10,15,"The place was completely lawless, and would encourage sailors to leave their ships for freedom when whalers landed."
The Piazza Tales,10,16,"So whalers wouldn't land there any more, though deserters in the Encantadas still made their way there."
The Piazza Tales,10,17,"That's it. Like Shmoop says, not much of a story, really, but you take what you can get."
The Piazza Tales,11,0,"This is about Norfolk Isle, northeast of Charles's Island."
The Piazza Tales,11,1,"This has a story too. A sad, sad, story of pathos, about turtles in love."
The Piazza Tales,11,2,"Okay, not about turtles in love. But yes about pathos."
The Piazza Tales,11,3,Shmoop would rather have turtles in love. But Melville did not ask Shmoop.
The Piazza Tales,11,4,Anyway.
The Piazza Tales,11,5,"So it's the narrator/Melville's first visit to the Galapagos, when a shipmate sees something fluttering in the distance."
The Piazza Tales,11,6,"They figure out it's a handkerchief, and sail off towards it."
The Piazza Tales,11,7,"Where they find a woman, stranded."
The Piazza Tales,11,8,Pathos!
The Piazza Tales,11,9,"And some turtles, as there always are on the Galapagos."
The Piazza Tales,11,10,The woman is named Hunilla; three years ago she'd sailed with her new husband Felipe and brother Truxill on a French whaler.
The Piazza Tales,11,11,The whaler put them on the island where they were to collect turtles for the oil; the captain was supposed to come back and get them.
The Piazza Tales,11,12,But he didn't. And they're screwed.
The Piazza Tales,11,13,"Even worse, Felipe and Truxill go on a fishing trip and are killed by a bad tide."
The Piazza Tales,11,14,"Hunilla is not having the best of luck. She is very sad. The sailors hearing her stories are sad. Ah, the pathos."
The Piazza Tales,11,15,Felipe's body came ashore and she buried him.
The Piazza Tales,11,16,"Hunilla doesn't know the ship isn't coming back, so she waits and waits. Scenes of great sadness etc. etc."
The Piazza Tales,11,17,"Hunilla kept a marker of days for a while, and then stopped. The implication is that she was pregnant and had a baby who was stillborn."
The Piazza Tales,11,18,"This is not said directly, though. (See Characters: Hunilla.)"
The Piazza Tales,11,19,"There's also some suggestion that a ship did come ashore and that a sailor or sailors raped Hunilla, though she won't talk about it."
The Piazza Tales,11,20,"Hunilla says it was lucky fate that led her to see the narrator's ship which has finally come to rescue her, because usually she's on the opposite side of the island."
The Piazza Tales,11,21,"They take her back to her hut, and she brings her oil and some turtles aboard the ship."
The Piazza Tales,11,22,"She's got a lot of dogs too, but has to leave a bunch of them."
The Piazza Tales,11,23,"So when they push off the island, the dogs left behind run along after her howling."
The Piazza Tales,11,24,"They sell her oil to give her money, and she leaves the ship at Payta. That's the end of a sad story."
The Piazza Tales,11,25,On to one with more murder and action.
The Piazza Tales,8,0,This is a really unusually pointless anecdote about U.S. explorer David Porter and his ship the Essex.
The Piazza Tales,8,1,"His crew saw a ship, tried to catch it, and didn't."
The Piazza Tales,8,2,"But it was in the Enchanted Isles, so everything seemed mysterious and…enchanted."
The Piazza Tales,8,3,"Shmoop note: ""The Encantadas"" was the most popular piece in The Piazza Tales, initially. Go figure."
The Piazza Tales,9,0,"Hey, there's a quote from Spenser. Hello quote from Spenser."
The Piazza Tales,9,1,"Melville tells you that Barrington Island was the home of pirates, or buccaneers."
The Piazza Tales,9,2,Its isolation meant that pirates could hang out without fear of being hunted down and arrested.
The Piazza Tales,9,3,"Barrington Island has trees and fruit and is generally pleasant, unlike all the other islands around. Thus a happy place for pirates."
The Piazza Tales,9,4,The narrative quotes some unknown sentimental traveler. Why? Maybe because random quotation is fun?
The Piazza Tales,9,5,"Anyway, the random quotation and Melville agree that pirates are awful, but argue that some of them are maybe not so bad."
The Piazza Tales,9,6,You wonder what the random quotation person would say if pirates robbed him. But that we shall never know.
The Piazza Tales,2,0,"Captain Amasa Delano, a Massachusetts commander of a sealer named The Bachelor's Delight, is near the coast of Chile."
The Piazza Tales,2,1,Delano sees a strange ship flying no colors.
The Piazza Tales,2,2,"He might have been worried, but he's a naturally trusting guy. Also (though Melville is too kind to say this outright) he is as dumb as a bagful of hammers."
The Piazza Tales,2,3,The ship maneuvers oddly. But dumb old Delano still isn't suspicious because he's dumb.
The Piazza Tales,2,4,"Shmoop has mentioned he's not the sharpest tack in the ocean, right? This will come up again."
The Piazza Tales,2,5,"As the ship gets closer, it becomes clear the ship (the San Dominick) is in bad disrepair."
The Piazza Tales,2,6,"Delano comes onboard, where there are many white and black people on the deck."
The Piazza Tales,2,7,"There's been fever, there's been scurvy, they were almost shipwrecked, they were becalmed."
The Piazza Tales,2,8,Things have been rough.
The Piazza Tales,2,9,Delano looks around; there are a number of black people on deck engaged in various tasks.
The Piazza Tales,2,10,"Four men are unwinding rope for the oakum, or threads."
The Piazza Tales,2,11,"Most notably, six black men are sharpening hatchets."
The Piazza Tales,2,12,"Now, the black people are supposed to be slaves. You might wonder what they're doing with weapons."
The Piazza Tales,2,13,You might. But Delano doesn't.
The Piazza Tales,2,14,"Delano approaches the Spanish captain (Benito Cereno), but the Captain doesn't say much. Delano assumes he's ill."
The Piazza Tales,2,15,Delano brings up some fish for the people on board; he sends his men off to go back to the ship and bring water for the Spanish crew.
The Piazza Tales,2,16,"Delano notices that the crew and the black slaves on board are not well disciplined, but he blames it on the Captain's illness, and general lack of energy."
The Piazza Tales,2,17,Delano is completely incapable of seeing the black people on board as actors in their own right; anything they do is attributed to Cereno (called Don Benito).
The Piazza Tales,2,18,"Delano asks Don Benito what happened on the voyage. Don Benito stutters and stammers, but finally comes out with it."
The Piazza Tales,2,19,"He says they ran into storms, lost many crew members, and so on."
The Piazza Tales,2,20,"He coughs and his servant gives him a drink of water, and watches him closely."
The Piazza Tales,2,21,"As the servant watches Don Benito, you be sure to watch that servant. He is tricky."
The Piazza Tales,2,22,The servant reassures Delano.
The Piazza Tales,2,23,"Don Benito goes on; they had a bad storm, and had to toss water kegs overboard."
The Piazza Tales,2,24,"The lack of water was bad news, and the crew succumbed to fever and scurvy."
The Piazza Tales,2,25,Don Benito praises the black slaves for their surprising discipline. It has indeed been surprising.
The Piazza Tales,2,26,"Don Benito also tells Delano that the slaves need no fetters, which should be a big old red flag for Delano, but he remains oblivious."
The Piazza Tales,2,27,Delano is one of the most oblivious heroes in all of American fiction. Ignorant bliss fills him from his ignorant nose to his blissful toes.
The Piazza Tales,2,28,"The servants name is Babo, who Don Benito praises extravagantly."
The Piazza Tales,2,29,Delano thinks cheerfully about how wonderful it is for slave and master to love each other.
The Piazza Tales,2,30,"So, yes, Delano thinks slavery is a beautiful thing. He is a racist twit, as well as being oblivious."
The Piazza Tales,2,31,The two things rather go together.
The Piazza Tales,2,32,"Delano offers to send three of his own officers aboard to help Don Benito get to Lima, Peru."
The Piazza Tales,2,33,"Don Benito lights up, but Babo pulls him off to the side, and then Don Benito is depressed and sad again."
The Piazza Tales,2,34,"It's almost like his servant scares and depresses him, rather than helps him out."
The Piazza Tales,2,35,"They go to the upper deck to get some air, and pass by the guys sharpening hatchets, which makes Delano nervous for a moment, as well it might."
The Piazza Tales,2,36,Delano brushes it off though. Slaves who have every reason to hate you equipped with hatchets—what could possibly go wrong!
The Piazza Tales,2,37,"Delano sees a black boy below them get in an argument with a white boy, and hit him in the head with a knife."
The Piazza Tales,2,38,"Delano is shocked, but Don Benito brushes it off."
The Piazza Tales,2,39,"Delano thinks, wow, this guy Don Benito is really completely passive. He is the Bartleby of the sea."
The Piazza Tales,2,40,Benito and Delano talk about what on earth the slaves are doing sharpening hatchets; Don Benito says that the damage to the ship was such that lots of things need sharpening.
The Piazza Tales,2,41,"He also explains that the slaves belonged to Alexandro Aranda, who he says died of fever."
The Piazza Tales,2,42,"Don Benito is really upset, but Delano burbles on about death at sea because (again) he's really oblivious."
The Piazza Tales,2,43,Don Benito is so upset he seems to think for a moment that Aranda is in fact onboard the ship still.
The Piazza Tales,2,44,Hint: that is foreshadowing.
The Piazza Tales,2,45,Then a black man in chains comes up to Don Benito.
The Piazza Tales,2,46,"Babo seems to be running the proceedings, and tells the man in chains, Atufal, to ask forgiveness of Don Benito."
The Piazza Tales,2,47,But Atufal doesn't and heads off again.
The Piazza Tales,2,48,Don Benito explains somewhat confusedly that Atufal offended him and he's put him in chains till he asks pardon.
The Piazza Tales,2,49,"Babo draws Don Benito off to have a private discussion, which seems pretty rude."
The Piazza Tales,2,50,"Delano starts to think that Don Benito is an imposter of some sort, plotting against him."
The Piazza Tales,2,51,"Nice try, Delano, but not quite."
The Piazza Tales,2,52,"But then he stops being suspicious, because that's our dumb Delano."
The Piazza Tales,2,53,"Don Benito comes back with Babo and starts asking a lot of questions about Delano's ship; how many men are onboard, what their supplies are like, what guns and weapons they have, and so forth."
The Piazza Tales,2,54,Don Benito and Babo go back to whispering. Delano is still not really suspicious.
The Piazza Tales,2,55,"If there were a zombie attack, Delano would be the first one dead."
The Piazza Tales,2,56,Don Benito goes down from the poop deck and exchanges significant glances with a Spanish sailor (who you later find out is named Luys Galgo) who Delano's seen looking at him before.
The Piazza Tales,2,57,"Nothing comes of that, though, and Delano wonders again back and forth if something suspicious is going on."
The Piazza Tales,2,58,How many times can Delano think the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over.
The Piazza Tales,2,59,And over.
The Piazza Tales,2,60,Without figuring anything out?
The Piazza Tales,2,61,Answer: Lots of times.
The Piazza Tales,2,62,"The boat is coming with more provisions, but the San Dominick is drifting, and so it's taking a long time."
The Piazza Tales,2,63,"Otherwise the story would come to a quick end, and Melville isn't done stringing you along."
The Piazza Tales,2,64,"Delano decides to try to talk to one of the Spaniards, though Don Benito said the crew was not very good or trustworthy."
The Piazza Tales,2,65,Then the American captain sees a Spaniard (later you learn his name is Hermenegildo Gandix) sticking his hands in a tar barrel under what appears to be the supervision of the blacks.
The Piazza Tales,2,66,"Delano has no success talking to him, and looks around for somebody else."
The Piazza Tales,2,67,He sees some black women and their children. He admires them because he thinks they are natural and unconscious in their love for their children.
The Piazza Tales,2,68,"If they love their children so, though, why are they happy that their kids are on a slaver? Hmm."
The Piazza Tales,2,69,"That's Shmoop wondering that, not Delano. Delano doesn't think of black people as human, so these sorts of questions wouldn't occur to him."
The Piazza Tales,2,70,"Instead he entertains this suspicion and that, worrying again that Don Benito is out to get him."
The Piazza Tales,2,71,"He thinks for a moment that maybe Don Benito is in league with the black slaves, but then decides the slaves are too dumb."
The Piazza Tales,2,72,Who's the dumb one again here?
The Piazza Tales,2,73,"Delano finally goes up to the Spanish sailor, Galgo, that he's been playing footsie with around the ship; the guy gives him a knot."
The Piazza Tales,2,74,The Spaniard tells him in English to cut the knot quick.
The Piazza Tales,2,75,"Hurry, Delano! Hurry! Save yourself!"
The Piazza Tales,2,76,But he doesn't.
The Piazza Tales,2,77,"Instead, one of the black watchers comes up, says the Spaniard is nutty but harmless, and takes the knot away from Delano."
The Piazza Tales,2,78,Then he throws it overboard.
The Piazza Tales,2,79,"Delano's fears evaporate out of his largely empty skull, poof."
The Piazza Tales,2,80,Then they come back.
The Piazza Tales,2,81,"That's the way of this story: worry, don't worry, worry, don't worry."
The Piazza Tales,2,82,It does go on.
The Piazza Tales,2,83,"The boat finally comes up with the water, and Don Benito serves it out."
The Piazza Tales,2,84,"While doing so, he gestures for the black people crowding around to back off."
The Piazza Tales,2,85,There's some disturbance and Delano thinks he's going to be killed at the order of Don Benito…but then the oakum pickers jump down and push everybody back.
The Piazza Tales,2,86,All is well.
The Piazza Tales,2,87,"Or not really, but Delano doesn't know that."
The Piazza Tales,2,88,"He notices that there are no small boats to help bring aboard supplies, and asks Don Benito what happened to them."
The Piazza Tales,2,89,Benito says that they were bashed in during the gales.
The Piazza Tales,2,90,"Delano asks him if the gales were around Cape Horn, as he said before. Benito says no, Delano is surprised that the story seems to have changed."
The Piazza Tales,2,91,"But…before this interesting line of inquiry can be pursued, Babo says its time to shave Don Benito."
The Piazza Tales,2,92,Which again seems odd. How can shaving be that important?
The Piazza Tales,2,93,"But anyway, they go down to the shaving area all together."
The Piazza Tales,2,94,"Babo punches Delano in the face over and over. Delano wonders absently if something could possibly be wrong onboard ship. Babo hits him in the face with a pie and explains that hitting people in the face with a pie and hitting them in the nose is an old Spanish custom, and nothing is amiss. ""Okeydoke,"" says Delano."
The Piazza Tales,2,95,Shmoop made that up. But it could have happened that way.
The Piazza Tales,2,96,"Anyway, shaving."
The Piazza Tales,2,97,Delano thinks absently that black people are naturally suited to be body servants.
The Piazza Tales,2,98,"Right, buddy, Babo thinks."
The Piazza Tales,2,99,They use a Spanish flag for a bib. Delano thinks this is funny and odd.
The Piazza Tales,2,100,Maybe it's a sign that the Spanish guy didn't choose the bib? Maybe?
The Piazza Tales,2,101,Don Benito shakes in the chair; Babo promises that he never cuts his master.
The Piazza Tales,2,102,"Delano expresses some doubt that a ship could really be becalmed for two months, and at just that moment Babo cuts Don Benito."
The Piazza Tales,2,103,"Benito is terrified, which Delano chalks up to the captain's low state."
The Piazza Tales,2,104,He wonders if Benito and Babo are acting out some play for him.
The Piazza Tales,2,105,"Then he thinks, nah. Couldn't be."
The Piazza Tales,2,106,The shaving is done; Delano leaves the two alone.
The Piazza Tales,2,107,Babo comes out with a cheek cut and says Benito cut him for slashing him during shaving.
The Piazza Tales,2,108,"Delano is sorry for Babo, but before he can say so, Babo goes back in…"
The Piazza Tales,2,109,And then Benito and Babo come out leaning on each other as if nothing has happened.
The Piazza Tales,2,110,"They see a man who is of mixed ancestry, black and white—referred to as mulatto (named Francesco), and Delano wonders if he's a good sort."
The Piazza Tales,2,111,"Benito says, sure he is."
The Piazza Tales,2,112,"Delano has heard racial theories that mulattos are particularly mean-spirited, so he's glad to hear that's not true."
The Piazza Tales,2,113,"How mean-spirited do you have to be to hate the people who enslave you, though?"
The Piazza Tales,2,114,"Again, not a question our buddy Delano asks himself."
The Piazza Tales,2,115,"Benito and Delano have lunch together with Babo helping to serve. He's never far away, that Babo."
The Piazza Tales,2,116,"In fact, Delano wants to have a private talk with Benito about expenses, and tries to get Babo sent away."
The Piazza Tales,2,117,But Benito won't do it.
The Piazza Tales,2,118,Benito becomes ever more withdrawn and unpleasant. What oh what could be the cause?
The Piazza Tales,2,119,Delano thinks Benito is depressed because there's no wind and the supplies can't come across.
The Piazza Tales,2,120,"But Delano says there's enough wind, and he says he'll get the ship in motion."
The Piazza Tales,2,121,He goes out and there's Atufal and the hatchet polishers.
The Piazza Tales,2,122,And when all's well he goes back below to see Don Benito.
The Piazza Tales,2,123,And he teases Don Benito about ordering Atufal around and being a hard master.
The Piazza Tales,2,124,Benito doesn't seem to think it's funny.
The Piazza Tales,2,125,Delano wants to cheer Benito up still; he is the irritating hallmark card of ship's captains.
The Piazza Tales,2,126,"Delano pops up on deck; sees his ship is getting closer, and pops down again. Pop, pop."
The Piazza Tales,2,127,He asks Benito if he will come over to Delano's ship for food and such; Benito says he can't do it.
The Piazza Tales,2,128,"Pop up, pop down. (Yes, again.)"
The Piazza Tales,2,129,Pop up.
The Piazza Tales,2,130,More vacillating about whether there's something wrong on ship.
The Piazza Tales,2,131,"The plot of ""Benito Cereno"" doesn't so much go forward as it wavers back and forth around the same point till Melville gets tired of it and ends the thing."
The Piazza Tales,2,132,"Finally, Delano is getting into the ship down the side of the boat to take him to his vessel."
The Piazza Tales,2,133,"Benito comes rushing out, but again seems of two minds—eager to say goodbye, while being held up by Babo."
The Piazza Tales,2,134,"Then, as Delano pulls away, Benito leaps overboard into the boat."
The Piazza Tales,2,135,Three other sailors leap overboard as well.
The Piazza Tales,2,136,"Delano isn't sure what's going on, but things Benito is trying to make the crew think he's been kidnapped."
The Piazza Tales,2,137,Babo brandishes a knife and comes over the side; the other black people are also making threatening movements.
The Piazza Tales,2,138,Delano still thinks that the former slaves are enraged on behalf of Don Benito.
The Piazza Tales,2,139,"Of all the obtuse protagonists in American fiction, Captain Delano, you are the obtuseist."
The Piazza Tales,2,140,Babo's knife comes at Delano; the Captain catches Babo and knocks him to the side; Don Benito faints; Babo tries to kill Don Benito.
The Piazza Tales,2,141,"Delano suddenly says, ""Oh!"" A little lightbulb goes on over his head. Babo was trying to stab Benito. Babo isn't a happy servant, but a freed slave who actually would rather be free."
The Piazza Tales,2,142,"Way to go, Captain Delano. You're so clever. No, really."
The Piazza Tales,2,143,He realizes now that the black people want to kill him and Don Benito both.
The Piazza Tales,2,144,The boat pulls away to The Bachelor's Delight.
The Piazza Tales,2,145,"Babo is taken prisoner, they all get on the sealer, where plans are made to go back with weapons and kill all the freed slaves."
The Piazza Tales,2,146,"Don Benito says they shouldn't because the black people are too desperate, but Delano decides to do it anyway (especially when he hears the black people don't have any firearms.)"
The Piazza Tales,2,147,"Delano wants to go himself, but he's considered too valuable, so one of his men commands the boarding and attack force."
The Piazza Tales,2,148,"There's a fight; the black men hurl hatchets and do some damage, but they're overmatched."
The Piazza Tales,2,149,"In the melee, Delano's men accidentally kill a couple of Spaniards as well."
The Piazza Tales,2,150,"And they shoot the Spaniard at the helm deliberately, even though he was kidnapped."
The Piazza Tales,2,151,"The ""good guys"" are kind of awful, basically."
The Piazza Tales,2,152,Atufal is killed too.
The Piazza Tales,2,153,"During the melee, the helm is revealed, and there's a skeleton tied to it. Good old gothic chill there (Melville might have written slasher films, if he'd lived a bit later.)"
The Piazza Tales,2,154,And the white people win.
The Piazza Tales,2,155,"The slave-traders and racists achieve victory, and the brave rebels fighting for freedom and humanity are defeated."
The Piazza Tales,2,156,Yay?
The Piazza Tales,2,157,"So, with that wonderful victory, they sail to Lima to put on trial and execute the remaining rebels."
The Piazza Tales,2,158,Don Benito is an exhausted mess.
The Piazza Tales,2,159,That's basically the end of thes story…but now you get the court deposition from Don Benito telling what happened.
The Piazza Tales,2,160,"So basically again the story goes back and forth rather than forward, and flips around here at the end to back before the beginning."
The Piazza Tales,2,161,"And Don Benito tells how the blacks suddenly revolted, and killed many of the Spaniards."
The Piazza Tales,2,162,"Babo, the leader, demanded to be taken to Senegal; Benito said okay, but said they needed water."
The Piazza Tales,2,163,Then Benito tries to head for ports where they might meet another ship that would save them.
The Piazza Tales,2,164,"Babo decides to kill Alexandro Aranda, the slave-owner, as a warning and because the former slaves can't be sure they'll stay free otherwise."
The Piazza Tales,2,165,"They kill a number of other sailors too, without mercy."
The Piazza Tales,2,166,"They also stove in the boats, to prevent anyone from escaping."
The Piazza Tales,2,167,And now the story gets around to the meeting with Delano.
The Piazza Tales,2,168,Cereno explains that Babo decided to deceive the American captain.
The Piazza Tales,2,169,"They set everything up carefully; the hatchet cleaners, for instance, were looking out for trouble, ready to use the weapons if needed."
The Piazza Tales,2,170,"Atufal, Babo's right-hand man, was chained, so he seemed harmless, though the chains could be discarded in an instant."
The Piazza Tales,2,171,"After Delano came aboard, Babo made Cereno find out from him the particulars of the sealer's defense, because Babo wanted to take over the other ship."
The Piazza Tales,2,172,Then Don Benito explains how he leaped into the boat and escaped—but you already read about that Shmoopers.
The Piazza Tales,2,173,"Now Don Benito goes on for a bit about how all the black people on the ship were in cahoots, including someone called José (the servant of Aranda, who got inside information), Francesco (the mulatto) and all the Ashantes (the men who sharpened the hatchets.)"
The Piazza Tales,2,174,"Don Benito points especially to Lebe and Yan, who put the skeleton of Aranda on the bow."
The Piazza Tales,2,175,"He also says that the black women were enthusiastic about the uprising, and wanted to kill Don Benito."
The Piazza Tales,2,176,He accuses the black women of singing melancholy songs to encourage the men to battle.
The Piazza Tales,2,177,"Singing songs is, apparently, an act of war."
The Piazza Tales,2,178,"He goes on to say that various people on board ship tried to warn Delano, but it didn't work because Delano was too thick (he doesn't quite say that, but that's what it means, more or less.)"
The Piazza Tales,2,179,"Apparently the boy who was cut with a knife had said something about hoping to escape, which is why the black boy hit him."
The Piazza Tales,2,180,"The sailor Luys Galgo, the guy who gave Delano the knot, was apparently killed while Delano was on board."
The Piazza Tales,2,181,The guy with his hands in the tar was a Marques forced to appear as a sailor.
The Piazza Tales,2,182,He had tar poured on his hands as a punishment.
The Piazza Tales,2,183,"Then he was made to appear on the side of the ship with a hatchet when the Americans were coming, and they shot him."
The Piazza Tales,2,184,"Some of the blacks were killed after their capture, but the Americans tried not to do that, because they wanted to execute everyone for the crime of trying to escape from slavery."
The Piazza Tales,2,185,Don Benito concludes that he is a mess and is going to give up seafaring for a monastery.
The Piazza Tales,2,186,And finally the last few page of the book are a deposition from Doctor Rozas.
The Piazza Tales,2,187,The doctor recounts Don Benito telling Delano how grateful he is to him.
The Piazza Tales,2,188,"Don Benito says he was terrified for Delano's safety, and only had the courage to jump overboard because he knew if he didn't Delano would be killed."
The Piazza Tales,2,189,"Which is all very nice, but a little undermined by the fact that Don Benito is a slaver trader. How compassionae can he be."
The Piazza Tales,2,190,"Don Benito also thinks Delano was super-lucky; he kept bouncing around and making rash gestures, but the blacks didn't kill him."
The Piazza Tales,2,191,"He was blessed by God, Don Benito says (though more like the Devil; at least, it's hard to imagine God blessing slavers.)"
The Piazza Tales,2,192,"Then they're all like, you saved my life, no you saved my life, no you're my best friend, blah blah blah."
The Piazza Tales,2,193,Theyr'e happy white supremacists together.
The Piazza Tales,2,194,"Babo refuses to talk, and is eventually killed and his head placed on a pole."
The Piazza Tales,2,195,"Benito tries never to see Babo again, and faints when he sees him in court. He himself dies three months later."
The Piazza Tales,2,196,Everybody's dead! Happy heroic ending!
The Piazza Tales,2,197,"Oh, wait, Delano's still alive. Sometimes the stupid and evil win, appears to be the message."
The Piazza Tales,3,0,This is another one of those Melville stories without much of a plot.
The Piazza Tales,3,1,"Still, it's got more of a point than ""The Piazza"". So that's something."
The Piazza Tales,3,2,"A dude (hereafter referred to as ""the dude"" or ""the narrator"") is standing inside by his hearth listening to the thunder outside."
The Piazza Tales,3,3,Some other guy comes and knocks on the door.
The Piazza Tales,3,4,Dude 1 asks second guy if he'd like to stand by the hearth.
The Piazza Tales,3,5,"No way, says dude two, and holds up a long rod (he's the lightning rod man of the title.)"
The Piazza Tales,3,6,The lightning rod man explains that you're in danger of getting hit by lightning if you stand by the hearth.
The Piazza Tales,3,7,"Dude 1 says, chill out man."
The Piazza Tales,3,8,"The lightning rod man tells him he sells lightning rods, and that only lightning rods can protect you in a storm."
The Piazza Tales,3,9,"Dude 1 finds out that the lightning guys rod was on a church that got zapped with lightning recently, and concludes that the rods aren't of much use anyway."
The Piazza Tales,3,10,"(Scientific note: lightning rods actually do work; dude 1 is underselling them, though the lightning rod salesman is overselling them."
The Piazza Tales,3,11,Back to your scheduled Shmoop narration.)
The Piazza Tales,3,12,"The narrator continues to razz the lightning rod salesman and suggest that he's a fool and a scammer, who travels in thunderstorms to scare people and get them to buy his rods."
The Piazza Tales,3,13,"The lightning-rod guy is undeterred though, and tells the narrator not to ring the bell or close the shutters or do much of anything or he'll get zapped by lightning."
The Piazza Tales,3,14,Lightning-rod guy blathers on and says it's safest to be in wet clothes in a lightning storm (Scientific note: no.)
The Piazza Tales,3,15,"He also says that in a storm he avoids just about everything, including other people."
The Piazza Tales,3,16,The narrator mocks him and points out that everybody dies sometime; who is this lightning-rod salesman to say he can control the heavens?
The Piazza Tales,3,17,The lightning-rod salesman gets cranky and attacks him with the rod.
The Piazza Tales,3,18,But our dude breaks the rod and sends lightning-rod guy packing.
The Piazza Tales,3,19,"But people still use fear to sell junk, the narrator concludes pithily."
The Piazza Tales,3,20,"That's the moral of the story, conveniently placed there at the end."
The Piazza Tales,5,0,"Another Spenser quote, this one about a monster."
The Piazza Tales,5,1,"Spenser writes about fairies, and The Enchanted Isles are a kind of blighted, evil faerie land. Is what Melville is getting at."
The Piazza Tales,5,2,"Also, he just kind of likes burbling about fairy-lands. (See ""The Piazza""—or don't, and just take Shmoop's word for it. You'll be happier.Stupid fairyland.)"
The Piazza Tales,5,3,"Anyway, Melville says that the Galapagos aren't all bad, and as proof points out that turtles are bright on their underbelly."
The Piazza Tales,5,4,"Then he describes turning the turtles over so they can't get back up, which seems kind of mean and not cheerful at all."
The Piazza Tales,5,5,"Then he talks about bringing the tortoises on board, and how they just keep walking and running into things."
The Piazza Tales,5,6,Which Melville finds depressing and eerie.
The Piazza Tales,5,7,"But then he and his companions ate turtle steak, and that was cheerful. So some good with the bad."
The Piazza Tales,4,0,"The story starts off with a quote from Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queeneabout dangerous islands that are dark, doleful, dreary, and other things beginning with ""d""."
The Piazza Tales,4,1,"The story proper begins with a discussion of the Enchanted Isles, or Encantadas, known in English as the Galapagos."
The Piazza Tales,4,2,"The islands were made by volcanos, and they are…well, dark, doleful and dreary, Shmoop supposes."
The Piazza Tales,4,3,"Melville says the islands are even more awful and desolate than other isolated places, because they're at the equator, where nothing changes."
The Piazza Tales,4,4,There aren't even jackals on the Galapagos; that's how forlorn it is. There are just reptiles.
The Piazza Tales,4,5,It's all volcanic rock and wasteland.
The Piazza Tales,4,6,Not a vacation spot (though of course these days people love to vacation on the Galapagos. Shows what giant leaps forward in transporation technology can do over a century and a half.)
The Piazza Tales,4,7,"The ocean currents are nasty too, which makes it hard to get from island to island."
The Piazza Tales,4,8,There's a superstition that reptiles are transformed wicked sea-officers.
The Piazza Tales,4,9,"Would being a turtle really be so bad? Turtles seem pretty content, really…."
The Piazza Tales,4,10,That is Shmoop's opinion there. Melville thinks turtles look sad.
The Piazza Tales,4,11,Melville says sometimes now at home he imagines himself back in those brutal islands.
The Piazza Tales,4,12,"This is sort of like ""The Piazza,"" but with turtles instead of Marianna."
The Piazza Tales,4,13,The turtles work better.
The Piazza Tales,1,0,"The story is also sometimes called ""Bartleby the Scrivener,"" and sometimes, ""Bartleby the Scrivener: A Story of Wall Street."""
The Piazza Tales,1,1,"It's one of the most famous, most critically acclaimed stories in all of American literature. So, you know, no pressure."
The Piazza Tales,1,2,The narrator is a somewhat elderly lawyer.
The Piazza Tales,1,3,"He says he's going to tell y'all about the weirdest, most bizarre scrivener (law copier) of all time, named Bartleby."
The Piazza Tales,1,4,Like the title of the story. By coincidence.
The Piazza Tales,1,5,"Anyway, the narrator tells you that he likes to take things easy, so he works as a non-trial lawyer with mortgages and such."
The Piazza Tales,1,6,"He has chambers on Wall Street, in a boring office that looks out on a wall."
The Piazza Tales,1,7,"Before Bartleby showed up, the narrator had two copyists; Turkey, Nippers, and an office-boy named Ginger Nut."
The Piazza Tales,1,8,"Turkey is around 60; he's a good worker in the morning, but in the afternoon his face gets ruddy and he becomes over-energetic and careless."
The Piazza Tales,1,9,The suggestion is that Turkey has too much to drink at lunch.
The Piazza Tales,1,10,"He tries to get Turkey to take afternoons off, but he won't."
The Piazza Tales,1,11,The narrator's utter failure to discipline his office staff comes back to haunt him later. Foreshadowing.
The Piazza Tales,1,12,"Nippers is an often irritated, ambitious man, who has debts."
The Piazza Tales,1,13,"However, he works hard, and dresses well, as opposed to Turkey, who is a mess."
The Piazza Tales,1,14,"Nippers' bad temper is caused by indigestion, and he's worse in the morning and usually better in the afternoon, as opposed to Turkey, who is the reverse."
The Piazza Tales,1,15,Ginger Nut is 12; his father is a carman and hopes that Ginger Nut will advance.
The Piazza Tales,1,16,"Ginger Nut fetches things in the office, including snacks for Turkey and Nippers."
The Piazza Tales,1,17,"So, characters all introduced…on to the plot!"
The Piazza Tales,1,18,"The plot is just about entirely composed of nothing happening, by the by (similar to ""The Piazza""—though this is a more interesting nothing.)"
The Piazza Tales,1,19,"Anyway, the narrator has too much work, so he needs to hire someone."
The Piazza Tales,1,20,"And he hires Bartleby—pallid, pitiable Bartleby."
The Piazza Tales,1,21,"Bartleby does a ton of work at first. Go, Bartleby, go. (It won't last.)"
The Piazza Tales,1,22,"Even at the beginning, though, Bartleby writes so silently and morosely that the narrator is a little put out. (That's the way with bosses; they don't just want you to do work, they want you to work happily.)"
The Piazza Tales,1,23,"Law copyists need to double check the copies against the original on occasion. This, the narrator says, is kind of boring."
The Piazza Tales,1,24,So the narrator asks Barlteby to help with comparing the copies.
The Piazza Tales,1,25,"Bartleby says ""I would prefer not to."""
The Piazza Tales,1,26,"The narrator is thunderstruck, but is too much in a hurry to confront Bartleby about it right away, so gets Nippers to copy the paper."
The Piazza Tales,1,27,A few days later they need to examine four copies of a single document. The narrator calls in Turkey and Nippers and Bartleby.
The Piazza Tales,1,28,"But again, Bartleby says he would prefer not to do the checking."
The Piazza Tales,1,29,The narrator appeals to Turkey and Nippers to see if Bartleby is acting badly. They agree he is.
The Piazza Tales,1,30,"But the narrator is again hurried by business, and is generally ineffectual, so they do the checking without Bartleby again."
The Piazza Tales,1,31,The narrator over time notices that Bartleby doesn't really seem to eat anything except the occasional ginger nut.
The Piazza Tales,1,32,"The narrator feels pity for Bartleby, and decides to try to indulge him, since he's useful even if he won't check copied pages."
The Piazza Tales,1,33,"But later he asks Bartleby to run an errand, and he prefers not to do that either."
The Piazza Tales,1,34,The narrator is mad…but then he decides he'll just go to dinner.
The Piazza Tales,1,35,Bartleby and the narrator are both indisposed to action of any sort.
The Piazza Tales,1,36,"So Bartleby stays on. Then one day the narrator goes to his offices on Sunday, and finds the door locked."
The Piazza Tales,1,37,Bartleby is living there.
The Piazza Tales,1,38,The narrator is afflicted with melancholy at the thought of Bartleby in the office all alone.
The Piazza Tales,1,39,"But that doesn't stop him from rifling through Bartleby's desk, and finding a bandanna with some money, Bartleby's savings."
The Piazza Tales,1,40,"The next day the narrator tries to get Bartleby to tell him where Bartleby was born, or anything about himself. He won't though."
The Piazza Tales,1,41,"The narrator notices that he himself, and others in the office, are using the word ""prefer"" in all sorts of situations. He finds this irritating and ominous."
The Piazza Tales,1,42,And after a bit Bartleby stops copying. He just stands in the office.
The Piazza Tales,1,43,"The narrator thinks that maybe Bartleby's eyes are strained, though Bartleby doesn't really explain anything."
The Piazza Tales,1,44,He has given up copying he says.
The Piazza Tales,1,45,"The narrator is as ineffectual as ever. He is sorry for Bartleby, and doesn't know what to do with him, so Bartleby just stays there, doing no work, taking up space."
The Piazza Tales,1,46,"Eventually the narrator pays Bartleby off, and tells him to leave."
The Piazza Tales,1,47,"The narrator leaves the office, feeling that he's finally triumphed, and gotten Bartleby to go."
The Piazza Tales,1,48,But has he?
The Piazza Tales,1,49,Spoiler Alert: No.
The Piazza Tales,1,50,"The narrator gets back to the office, and Bartleby is still there."
The Piazza Tales,1,51,"He argues with Bartleby again. He might as well argue with a blank thing that says ""I prefer not to."""
The Piazza Tales,1,52,"But the narrator's still not willing to throw him out, either because of compassion or general ineffectualness, it's not clear."
The Piazza Tales,1,53,"So Bartleby stays around doing nothing, just hanging out."
The Piazza Tales,1,54,"And he would have just left him there, but various professional acquaintances of the narratornotice that Bartleby is there, and they get cranky about it."
The Piazza Tales,1,55,"So…the narrator decides to abandon the offices to Bartleby, and move himself elsewhere."
The Piazza Tales,1,56,"He does so, and then the person who rents the offices from him comes to him and says, what on earth is this Bartleby person doing in my new offices?"
The Piazza Tales,1,57,"The narrator says, hey, he's not my problem."
The Piazza Tales,1,58,"But the new guy is more energetic, and tosses Barlteby out."
The Piazza Tales,1,59,But…the narrator learns a little later that Bartleby is now haunting the landing and the stairs and upsetting the people in the building.
The Piazza Tales,1,60,The narrator is prevailed on to go and try to get Bartleby to move.
The Piazza Tales,1,61,"He asks him if he'd like to work as a clerk, or go to Europe, or come with the narrator to his house."
The Piazza Tales,1,62,Shocker: it doesn't work.
The Piazza Tales,1,63,So the narrator runs away.
The Piazza Tales,1,64,He finds out a few days later that Bartleby has finally been carted off by the police.
The Piazza Tales,1,65,"The narrator goes to visit Bartleby in prison; Bartleby won't speak to him, and won't eat either."
The Piazza Tales,1,66,The narrator pays the grub man in prison to feed Bartleby. It doesn't seem to do much good.
The Piazza Tales,1,67,"When the narrator comes back a few days later, the grub man says Bartleby won't eat."
The Piazza Tales,1,68,Bartleby seems to be sleeping—but in fact he's dead.
The Piazza Tales,1,69,"The narrator says he's found nothing more about Bartleby, except that he may have been a clerk in the Dead Letter office of the post office."
The Piazza Tales,1,70,That's where undeliverable letters go.
The Piazza Tales,1,71,The narrator says that this job may have led Bartleby to be melancholy.
The Piazza Tales,1,72,He finished by expressing sympathy for Bartleby and all humanity.
The Piazza Tales,1,73,"Like most of what the narrator does, this doesn't do anyone much good."
The Piazza Tales,0,0,The narrator quotes from Shakespeare's Cymbeline. There's a lot of quoting in this story.
The Piazza Tales,0,1,"Narrator says he's moved out to the country, to a house without a piazza, or porch."
The Piazza Tales,0,2,The lack of a piazza makes him sad.
The Piazza Tales,0,3,"Yes, that's an important plot point. The house has no porch—conflict!"
The Piazza Tales,0,4,"This is not a two-fisted, pulse-pounding tale, in case you couldn't tell already."
The Piazza Tales,0,5,The house is old; it's got a big elm tree by it.
The Piazza Tales,0,6,"You can also see Mount Greylock from the house, the highest peak in Massachusetts, (which you could see from Melville's real-life house at Arrowhead.)"
The Piazza Tales,0,7,"The narrator compares Greylock to the ancient King Charlemagne, because that's the sort of labored, cutesy narrator you've got here."
The Piazza Tales,0,8,"Three paragraphs in, Shmoop doesn't know the narrator's name, but still, Shmoop would like to never know his name and never hear from him again."
The Piazza Tales,0,9,"Narrator decides to build a piazza. He wonders which side of the house to put it on. He hems and haws, but eventually decides on the north, so he can see Mount Greylock."
The Piazza Tales,0,10,"Folks laugh at the narrator for building a porch to the north, since that isn't usually where you put a porch. But the narrator is unconventional. Good for him."
The Piazza Tales,0,11,"Sitting on his porch reminds him of the sea, because Melville went to sea, and is famous for his sea tales. So this bit is kind of a branding exercise; he's letting readers know that they haven't wandered into the wrong restaurant."
The Piazza Tales,0,12,"At some point in his sitting on the porch, he spies a spot that interests him."
The Piazza Tales,0,13,"He tries looking at it over a year or so, but can never really pin it down."
The Piazza Tales,0,14,"What could it be? He's reading Midsummer's Night Dream, so it must be something fanciful and filled with fairy dust."
The Piazza Tales,0,15,Fairy dust…ah…ah…choooo!
The Piazza Tales,0,16,Excuse Shmoop.
The Piazza Tales,0,17,"The narrator is somewhat ill too, it sounds like. Not clear if he's sneezing though."
The Piazza Tales,0,18,But despite illness he decides to set off for fairy land.
The Piazza Tales,0,19,He fights Harry Potter in a duel to the death.
The Piazza Tales,0,20,"No, not really."
The Piazza Tales,0,21,"But somehow or other he gets to a pasture, and comes to a house."
The Piazza Tales,0,22,He finds a girl named Marianna sewing at a window.
The Piazza Tales,0,23,"She lives with her brother, who is out most of the day, and so she is very lonely."
The Piazza Tales,0,24,"She can see the narrator's house from her window, and thinks whoever lives there must be happy."
The Piazza Tales,0,25,"That's irony, folks, because the narrator is melancholy too."
The Piazza Tales,0,26,They talk about a passing cloud. Then they talk about the cloud some more. Not much happening in a story when you need to spend a page talking about a cloud.
The Piazza Tales,0,27,The cloud's shadow looks like a dog. True story.
The Piazza Tales,0,28,"More talk about clouds, more Marianna being sad and lonely."
The Piazza Tales,0,29,She wishes she could see whoever it is who lives in the house.
The Piazza Tales,0,30,The narrator tells her he wishes he were the inhabitant of that happy house.
The Piazza Tales,0,31,"But then he's back at his piazza, and you realize the whole conversation with Marianns was a vain fancy."
The Piazza Tales,0,32,Some people imagine unicorns and flying and explosions and exciting things when they daydream. The narrator just imagines some lonely person far off who watches clouds.
The Piazza Tales,0,33,She haunts him with her unreal reality.
The Piazza Tales,0,34,"That's it. Yes, it's a whole story about sitting on a porch looking out while imagining someone else sitting by a window looking at you. And ocassionally talking about clouds."
The Piazza Tales,0,35,"The next story's better, Shmoop promises."
The Piazza Tales,13,0,The narrator (or Melville) tells you that no other part of the world has as many hermits living there as the Galapagos.
The Piazza Tales,13,1,"Captains can be tyrannical and awful, and escaping into the Galapagos is one of the few ways sailors have to get away."
The Piazza Tales,13,2,"Turtle-hunting makes hermits sometimes too; people go into the interiors, get lost, and their ships leave without them."
The Piazza Tales,13,3,Or sometimes people are exiled by their captains.
The Piazza Tales,13,4,"He tells a story of a guy marooned on an island who was dying of thirst, till he came upon a seal, stabbed it, and sucked its blood."
The Piazza Tales,13,5,Ick.
The Piazza Tales,13,6,Vampire travel writing.
The Piazza Tales,13,7,And another story about a guy who escaped an island by killing seals and making a float of their corpses.
The Piazza Tales,13,8,He says people sometimes post bottles with messages in them on sticks; a kind of hermits' post office.
The Piazza Tales,13,9,"And as a cheery end, he talks about gravestones on the islands."
The Piazza Tales,13,10,"And that's it. Farewell, Galapagos novella. You were long, and your popularity is hard to figure, but at least Shmoop is done with you."
The Piazza Tales,12,0,Spooky Spenser quote about some evil guy.
The Piazza Tales,12,1,"Off to Hood's Isle, and a story about a hermit named Oberlus, who killed people."
The Piazza Tales,12,2,Oberlus is evil-looking and dressed in rags. He lives all alone on the island.
The Piazza Tales,12,3,He gets delusions of grandeur and decides he wants subjects. He gets hold of a firearm from somewhere.
The Piazza Tales,12,4,Oberlus sees a black sailor working and tries to kidnap him for his slave.
The Piazza Tales,12,5,"But the black man escapes, and Oberlus is captured and whipped. But then he escapes again."
The Piazza Tales,12,6,"Oberlus gets craftier, and rather than trying to steal sailors by force, he lures them to his hut, gets them drunk, and then ties them up till their ships leave."
The Piazza Tales,12,7,"He then keeps them as slaves (about four of them in all), using his blunderbuss and cruelty to keep them in line."
The Piazza Tales,12,8,"Through ill-treatment they become in time allied with him and join him in his criminal endeavors. (This seems unlikely, but oh well.)"
The Piazza Tales,12,9,"Oberlus decides to try to capture a ship, murder the crew, and take off from the island."
The Piazza Tales,12,10,"One ship lands, and Oberlus manages to steal a boat."
The Piazza Tales,12,11,"When another ship comes in, it founds Oberlus gone with his slaves/confederates."
The Piazza Tales,12,12,He gets to Payta without his confederates (maybe he killed them).
The Piazza Tales,12,13,"He finds a woman in Payta who he hopes to get to come back to Hood's Island, but before that can happen he is arrested for sneaking around."
The Piazza Tales,12,14,"And the story leaves him in prison, though it doesn't say whether he died there."
The Piazza Tales,12,15,"Then there's a paragraph assuring you that this story is really true, really. (It's like that ""based on a true story"" line in movies; it's supposed to be better or niftier because it actually happened.)"
The Piazza Tales,6,0,More Spenser. Go away Spenser.
The Piazza Tales,6,1,Melville talks about how cool towers are in general.
The Piazza Tales,6,2,"Then he talks about a cool elevated Rock called Rock Redondo, or Round Rock."
The Piazza Tales,6,3,It's a round rock. You can climb up it and look out and see far away. (Look! Turtles! Also…more rocks!)
The Piazza Tales,6,4,"But first the narrator (Melville, more or less) goes back and describes the first time he came to the Rodondo. It was pretty."
The Piazza Tales,6,5,"He says it's also a good place to see birds, like penguins and pelicans."
The Piazza Tales,6,6,"And then there are lots of fish in the water roundabout, who are easy to catch since they haven't dealt with human beings much."
The Piazza Tales,6,7,And now up the rock.
The Piazza Tales,7,0,Mount Pisgah is in the Bible; that's the reference there.
The Piazza Tales,7,1,"Melville gets silly and says to climb the rock, you should travel round the world and learn juggling."
The Piazza Tales,7,2,The point is that you can't really climb the rock. So this is a sort of imaginative vision.
The Piazza Tales,7,3,"He says you can see the coast of South America, and other islands about."
The Piazza Tales,7,4,Has he mentioned it's very isolated yet? It's very isolated.
The Piazza Tales,7,5,He tells the story of a ship that tried to get from Peru to Chili which took four months to go a ten day trip because of nasty calms and currents.
The Piazza Tales,7,6,"But the great explorer Juan Fernandez finally figured out that you need to put your ship farther out to sea rather than hugging the coast, and that works much better."
The Piazza Tales,7,7,Back to the rock and looking out; he describes some other islands.
The Piazza Tales,7,8,"He describes the inhabitants of Albemarle, which include no people, and lots of lizards, snakes and spiders."
The Piazza Tales,7,9,It also has an inlet where sperm whales come.
The Piazza Tales,7,10,(Pause here to insert the entirety of Moby Dick. )
The Piazza Tales,7,11,"There's an anecdote about William Cowley, an explorer who named an island after himself, calling it Cowley's Enchanted Isle."
The Piazza Tales,7,12,"He called it an enchanted isle because it seemed to change shape and aspect. He called it Cowley's island because he was egotistical, presumably (Melville doesn't really say.)"
The Piazza Tales,14,0,This is a gothic thriller type story with a twist ending.
The Piazza Tales,14,1,"It's about Bannadonna, a somewhat sinister architect, and the bell-tower he built."
The Piazza Tales,14,2,The most difficult part of building the tower was the crafting of the giant bell.
The Piazza Tales,14,3,"During the melting and forging process, the workmen were scared."
The Piazza Tales,14,4,"Bannadonna was worried their fear would cause them to shirk and damage the bell, so he hits the chief on the head with a giant ladle, killing him."
The Piazza Tales,14,5,A bit of the ladle falls into the smelting
The Piazza Tales,14,6,"As a result, the bell has a blemish; but Bannadonna covers it over."
The Piazza Tales,14,7,"Bad move, Bannadonna."
The Piazza Tales,14,8,Also maybe you shouldn't have murdered a guy. Geez.
The Piazza Tales,14,9,But the townspeople just shrug off the homicide as a sign of artistic temperament.
The Piazza Tales,14,10,"Anyway, Bannadonna is secluded in his workshop working on some other thing."
The Piazza Tales,14,11,"This is the secret bit setting up the surprise ending, if you couldn't tell."
The Piazza Tales,14,12,The covered over thing is eventually moved to the belfry.
The Piazza Tales,14,13,The chief-magistrate and one of his buddies go up to the belfry to try to figure out what the secret is. But Bannadonna won't tell them.
The Piazza Tales,14,14,They think it's sort of human like. (Cue ominous music.)
The Piazza Tales,14,15,"Anyway, he shows them a complicated clock/bell thing, which is to ring the hours the next day."
The Piazza Tales,14,16,Each hour has a female statue by it.
The Piazza Tales,14,17,"The magistrates are freaked out because the statues don't all look alike, and one looks like the prophetess Debra from a famous painting by Del Fonca (who appears to be a painter made up by Melville.)"
The Piazza Tales,14,18,"All of this is supposed to be somewhat ominous, though it's rather confused. Why would it be weird for statues to not look exactly alike?"
The Piazza Tales,14,19,"This sort of has a B-horror movie feel, where the music and the overacting lets you know that things are supposed to be scary even when the plot doesn't make a lot of sense."
The Piazza Tales,14,20,"Anyway, Bannadonna explains at length that you can't necessarily make all statues look alike in an era before industrial standardization."
The Piazza Tales,14,21,"They head downstairs, and the magistrate and his buddy think they hear someone moving upstairs in the belfry. Bannadonna assures them it's just the Frankenstein monster and the Terminator doing a rumba."
The Piazza Tales,14,22,"No, he doesn't say that. He says nothing's there."
The Piazza Tales,14,23,More ominous music.
The Piazza Tales,14,24,And Bannadonna locks them out. (Most ominous music.)
The Piazza Tales,14,25,The next day people gather to hear the bell ring…but it doesn't.
The Piazza Tales,14,26,So they go upstairs and find some sort of statue/robot thing standing over his bleeding body. (Crescendo on that ominous music.)
The Piazza Tales,14,27,"It seems that Bannadonna built a kind of human-looking mechanism to strike the hour, but he got caught in it, and so it bashed him to death as it tried to strike the hour."
The Piazza Tales,14,28,"It takes Melville forever to say this, and it's all couched in maybes and superstitious burbling and ominous music, but that's the gist of it."
The Piazza Tales,14,29,"So it's basically the Frankenstein story, but the monster never actually comes to life, which makes it all seem kind of pointless."
The Piazza Tales,14,30,"At Bannadonna's funeral, the bell is rung, but ends up crashing down because of a weakness at its top (that's the bit Bannadonna tried to hide.)"
The Piazza Tales,14,31,"They make a new bell, which works for a while, but then on the one-year anniversary of the tower, an earthquake knocks it over."
The Piazza Tales,14,32,"Strange event, Shmoopers. Strange, mysterious events. Don't mess with nature, scientists or bell ringers. Vincent Price now wishes you good night."
Sister Carrie,10,0,"The narrator introduces us to some of the other occupants of the apartment building where Carrie and Drouet live: Mr. Frank Hale, the manager of a theater and his wife, Mrs. Hale, whom Carrie sometimes hangs out with. The Hales aren't rich, but Mrs. Hale sure wishes they were. The railroad treasurer's wife and her well-dressed, piano-playing daughter live across the hall."
Sister Carrie,10,1,"One night, Carrie sits looking out her window and listens to the daughter play the piano; she starts feeling depressed. Drouet comes home and discovers Carrie sitting there crying. She obviously must be upset because she's been missing him, he thinks. So, completely misreading the situation, he suggests they waltz."
Sister Carrie,10,2,Carrie's not feeling it.
Sister Carrie,10,3,"Then we hop back to that night at the end of the previous chapter, though instead of being in Carrie and Drouet's apartment, we're with Hurstwood in the cab. He's thinking about how great Carrie is and decides to send her flowers."
Sister Carrie,10,4,"Fast forward a few weeks: Drouet returns from a business trip, and on his way back to the apartment he runs into a ""lady acquaintance."" He wastes no time inviting her to dinner—a dinner that lasts two and a half hours."
Sister Carrie,10,5,"And who just happens to be at the very same restaurant? Yup—Hurstwood, whose first thought is to feel sorry for Carrie. Drouet can tell that Hurstwood pretends not to see him and he's already trying to concoct some explanation."
Sister Carrie,10,6,"Soon after that night, Drouet shows up at Hurstwood's office. Hurstwood tells him right off the bat that he saw him at dinner that night, but Drouet plays it off by explaining that the lady was an old acquaintance who pressured him into dining together."
Sister Carrie,10,7,"Hurstwood invites Drouet and Carrie to dinner. For the first time, Hurstwood begins to see Drouet as his competition, but he feels more than up to the challenge."
Sister Carrie,10,8,"A few days later, Drouet finds Carrie primping in front of the mirror and accuses her of getting vain. Nevertheless, he tells her to get dressed and he'll take her to a show. But Carrie's already got plans with Mrs. Hale to go a fair and she's not about to cancel them, despite Drouet's protestations."
Sister Carrie,10,9,"However, just then a letter arrives from Hurstwood inviting them to the theater that evening. Carrie suddenly has no qualms about ditching Mrs. Hale."
Sister Carrie,10,10,"Drouet and Carrie meet Hurstwood in the theater lobby, and Carrie and Hurstwood flirt up a storm before the play starts. She is totally crushing on him and thinks about how Drouet totally pales in comparison."
Sister Carrie,11,0,"Breakfast at the Hurstwood household begins with trouble: George Jr. tells Hurstwood that he saw him at the theater last night. Mrs. Hurstwood grills him about the specifics, wanting to know what he saw and who he saw it with."
Sister Carrie,11,1,"Hurstwood explains that he went with Drouet and his wife, trying to make it seem like it was some business outing. Mrs. Hurstwood doesn't press him further, but she isn't buying it one bit."
Sister Carrie,11,2,She changes the subject and informs him that she expects him to accompany her that afternoon as she entertains some acquaintances of theirs. Hurstwood isn't happy because these people are total bores and he's got a ton of work to do.
Sister Carrie,11,3,"Apparently Mrs. H does the same thing again soon after (ropes him into hanging out with her boring friends), eventually inspiring Hurstwood to draw a line and tell her he's too busy. She throws back in his face that he wasn't too busy for theater dates with Drouet and Carrie. Burn."
Sister Carrie,11,4,"We jump to Carrie and Mrs. Hale riding through the city for the sole purpose of ogling other people's fancy houses. This is Mrs. Hale's favorite pastime. As they ride along, Carrie fantasizes about perfect people living their perfect lives inside the perfect houses."
Sister Carrie,11,5,Carrie returns to her apartment and has a newfound appreciation for just how meager the place is in comparison to all those mansions. She climbs into the old rocking chair and mopes.
Sister Carrie,11,6,"Hurstwood drops by, and Carrie thinks that he must not be aware that Drouet is out of town (yeah, sure…)."
Sister Carrie,11,7,"Okay, it turns out he actually didn't know, though he's not too broken up about Drouet's absence. Carrie and Hurstwood hang out and he tells her about all the cool places he's been in his life. She's even more smitten—this guy really gets her in a way Drouet never has, she thinks."
Sister Carrie,11,8,Hurstwood says that he can tell that Carrie isn't happy with her living situation. How in the world did he know? Their eyes meet and he makes a bold move by touching her hand.
Sister Carrie,11,9,"She resists, but doesn't run or kick him out ""as she might have done."" He stays a bit longer and they talk."
Sister Carrie,11,10,"After he leaves, she feels guilty. Hurstwood, however, is thrilled because it's obvious to him that Carrie is really into him. He whistles all the way home."
Sister Carrie,8,0,"Meet Hurstwood. Okay, yeah, we've technically already met the guy, but now we're going to follow him around for a while."
Sister Carrie,8,1,"Hurstwood lives in a pretty swank, ten-room house; he's married with a son, George Jr., and daughter, Jessica. They're all waited on by servants who usually don't last long because Mrs. (Julia) Hurstwood is so hard to please. Despite having an enormous house filled with ridiculously fancy and expensive furniture, the Hurstwood home lacks spirit. Money can't buy everything…"
Sister Carrie,8,2,"Hurstwood thinks his seventeen-year-old daughter Jessica is becoming kind of a spoiled brat, obsessed with trying to impress all the super-rich kids at her high school with her wardrobe (the Hurstwoods, we're told, are only kind of rich). For his part, George Jr. is hooked up with a good job in a real estate firm, but doesn't bother to pay his parents any rent."
Sister Carrie,8,3,"Mrs. Hurstwood is kind of a wannabe. She doesn't really fit into the most elite social circles, which makes it all the more crucial that her kids are able to. She has high hopes that her husband will continue to climb the corporate ladder so she can reap the benefits of his money and power."
Sister Carrie,8,4,"Warm and fuzzy family, right? Not."
Sister Carrie,8,5,"It's dinnertime at the Hurstwood house. George Jr. announces his upcoming plans to visit a friend's fancy boat, and sister and mom are totally impressed. Hurstwood cuts out early, telling the others that he's headed downtown."
Sister Carrie,8,6,"Hurstwood leaves and Jessica tells Mrs. Hurstwood that she's going to be in a play at school, which of course is going to require her to run out and buy a new outfit."
Sister Carrie,8,7,"Apparently Jessica has recently hung out with the son of a soap manufacturer, and Mrs. Hurstwood is super psyched about this prospect."
Sister Carrie,8,8,"We learn more about Hurstwood's attitudes towards his family. A scene is recounted from the past in which Hurstwood took a business trip during which it's hinted that he may have had an affair; Mrs. Hurstwood suspects he did, and ever since then she's been secretly retaliating by spending more of his money on clothes. Go team."
Sister Carrie,9,0,"It seems as though Carrie has moved into Drouet's three-bedroom apartment—her trunk and clothing are there, and we're told she's been hanging out there a lot and cooking for him. Plus, she's plagued by a guilty conscience over what she's done… though what she's done isn't spelled out."
Sister Carrie,9,1,"Drouet tells Carrie about how he invited Hurstwood over, and Carrie feels a little worried about what this guy will think of their living situation. Drouet tries to reassure her by saying, ""He doesn't know anything. You're Mrs. Drouet now."""
Sister Carrie,9,2,Wait—what? Did we miss the wedding?
Sister Carrie,9,3,"No, no we didn't. It turns out Drouet is only pretending that they're married, but he has managed to bring up a sore subject because Carrie immediately asks why it is they haven't gotten married yet (since he'd promised). He gives her some baloney excuse about needing to wrap up a property deal before he can tie the knot."
Sister Carrie,9,4,"But lest you think Carrie is head over heels for Drouet, think again. She's actually getting a little bored with the guy and wants to get married mostly for the sake of appearances (it's 1889 after all, not an era in which society is generally okay with moving in together before marriage)."
Sister Carrie,9,5,"Hurstwood arrives… and move over, Drouet. Now here's a guy Carrie could really fall for… and she starts to do just that from the moment he walks in."
Sister Carrie,9,6,"Instead of feeling threatened, Drouet senses Hurstwood's approval of Carrie (he's being extra charming to her) and is pleased that he's managed to bag a babe that's so attractive to a man of Hurstwood's caliber."
Sister Carrie,9,7,"Drouet and Hurstwood teach Carrie to play euchre. There's some mild flirtation going on between Hurstwood and Carrie, but Drouet still seems cool with the situation."
Sister Carrie,9,8,"Before Hurstwood leaves, he invites them both to the theater. He also insists that the next time Drouet is away on business, he's just got to let Hurstwood show Carrie around. Drouet agrees without batting an eye."
Sister Carrie,9,9,Carrie and Drouet concur: Hurstwood is just the best.
Sister Carrie,24,0,"Hurstwood gets back to his office and mulls over the problem of his wife and his other problem of Carrie failing to show up. He puffs on a cigar for a while, and then decides to send a messenger to take the money to his wife. He feels like a total loser for caving to her."
Sister Carrie,24,1,"Hurstwood hangs out with some coworkers. The messenger returns to say that he delivered the money and that Mrs. Hurstwood had said ""it was high time"" (25.23)."
Sister Carrie,24,2,"He goes to sleep, but tosses and turns. The next day, he goes to the office and checks his mail—still no word from Carrie. He begins to wonder how he's going to get her away from Drouet, so he fires off a letter asking where she was the day before and if she'll meet him as soon as possible."
Sister Carrie,24,3,"Days pass with no word from Carrie. He does get a letter from Mrs. Hurstwood's lawyers asking Hurstwood to contact them, though."
Sister Carrie,24,4,"A few days later, Hurstwood goes to Carrie's apartment to see what's up. But when he gets to her building, he gets paranoid that a guy nearby is watching him, so he leaves. On his way back, he passes by the building where George Jr. works, which reminds him that his kids haven't seemed to care that he's been gone."
Sister Carrie,24,5,"Hurstwood gets back to the office and chats with some friends, but he still feels pretty crappy. He eats dinner and returns to the office. He buries himself in work to try and distract himself from his personal problems."
Sister Carrie,24,6,The next day he gets a notice in the mail from Mrs. H's lawyers. Uh-oh—it's a warning that Mrs. H is going to file for divorce and alimony the next day.
Sister Carrie,24,7,Hurstwood is livid. He goes out for a walk to try and cool off.
Sister Carrie,25,0,"We pick up with Carrie who is right where we last left her: alone in the apartment right after Drouet stormed out. Having never seen him so upset, she's dumfounded."
Sister Carrie,25,1,"Carrie climbs into the old rocking chair to think about her predicament. If Drouet never comes back, she knows she's not going to be able to stay in the apartment. She thinks about what a total jerk Hurstwood is, though she still has some attraction to him; most of all, she feels alone. She realizes she's starving and goes to the cupboard to get something to eat, and as she's munching, she starts to worry about her financial situation."
Sister Carrie,25,2,She checks her purse to see how much money she has. Only seven dollars? Ugh. She worries more. She's not sure whether she wants Drouet to come back or not.
Sister Carrie,25,3,"Remember that day Carrie was supposed to meet Hurstwood in the park but never showed? Apparently, she goes looking for work instead of meeting up with him. But it rains (remember that little detail, too?) so she goes back home."
Sister Carrie,25,4,"The next day she goes off to look for work again in the business district. As she wanders around, she thinks maybe she doesn't need to get a job right away after all. It's Saturday so everything's closing early anyway, and she might as well go to the park instead, she figures."
Sister Carrie,25,5,"She hangs around the apartment for most of Sunday, thinking about how she should really try pursuing that acting thing she was so good at."
Sister Carrie,25,6,"Bright and early Monday morning, she heads to the Chicago Opera House, but when she gets there she's so intimidated that she can't work up the courage to go inside. She tries a few other theaters, but chickens out with them too."
Sister Carrie,25,7,"That night she hangs out with her old pal Mrs. Hale, but finds no comfort."
Sister Carrie,25,8,"Carrie returns to the Chicago Opera House the next day. She makes more progress this time by telling the ticket-taker that she's interested in getting work in the theater. The ticket guy directs Carrie to the manager's office, who she nervously asks how she should go about getting on the stage. He and his entourage can barely contain their laughter at the naiveté of this girl; the manager humors her a little by advising her to try to become a chorus girl."
Sister Carrie,25,9,The manager invites her to lunch. Alarm bells go off in her head—she figures it's probably not her acting that he's interested in. She says that she has another engagement and he tells her to come back again sometime—he might have something for her.
Sister Carrie,25,10,"She does end up going back to inquire about his offer, but by then he's resentful at having been brushed off by this little nobody, so he tells her he has nothing for her. He adds that she should go to New York City where there are more opportunities for beginners."
Sister Carrie,25,11,"Carrie goes to another theater, but can't find anyone to talk to. On her way home she stops at the post office, and there it is: the letter Hurstwood had written her asking why she never showed that day."
Sister Carrie,25,12,"She writes a letter that basically tells him off and mails it the next day. Then she goes downtown to look for work in department stores. No luck. She returns home to find out that Drouet's been back to get some of his stuff, and feels so lonely that she starts crying."
Sister Carrie,25,13,"We learn that Drouet came back intending to use the old ""I'm here to get my stuff"" excuse as a way to see Carrie and get back together. When he saw she wasn't there though, he took his stuff and left."
Sister Carrie,2,0,"Carrie finally works up the nerve to go into a dry goods store (similar to a modern-day department store) to ask if they're hiring. But she can't find anyone to ask, and she starts to feel overwhelmed so she leaves."
Sister Carrie,2,1,"She continues to walk the downtown streets. She thinks about going back to the dry goods store and turns back, but along the way she spots another prospect: a shoe company. She asks if they need help, but is told that they don't. Argh."
Sister Carrie,2,2,"The rejection isn't too devastating though—the man she talked to was polite, which encourages her so much that she tries her luck at a clothing company. This time, the manager she talks to is a jerk from the get-go; she doesn't even have it in her to ask if the company is hiring and leaves."
Sister Carrie,2,3,"After some more walking, she realizes she's starving… too bad the only thing she can afford on the menu of the restaurant she goes to is soup. But it revives her enough to continue the job search."
Sister Carrie,2,4,"Carrie makes her way back to the dry goods store. The good news: she finds someone to talk to about getting a job. The bad news: they won't hire her because she has no experience. She's confronted with that super annoying catch for first-time job seekers: she needs experience to get a job, but she needs a job to get experience."
Sister Carrie,2,5,"But all is not lost, and the guy she talks to at the dry goods place gives her a tip that department stores often hire young women to be clerks (presumably without experience)."
Sister Carrie,2,6,"So it's off to the department sto— Wait, not so fast. The narrator gives us another little tutorial on the history of the department store first. The department store was just popping up in the U.S. around the time that the novel is set and, boy, were these stores a big deal. (You think the mall is crowded on the weekend these days? That's nothing compared to the mobs of shoppers in the late nineteenth century.)"
Sister Carrie,2,7,"Once inside the store, Carrie is totally mesmerized by all the stuff: ""the remarkable displays of trinkets, dress goods, stationery, and jewelry."" Uh, what happened to the job search?"
Sister Carrie,2,8,"Carrie's pretty bummed out by the fact that she can't afford to buy anything. To top it off, she's really jealous of all the well-dressed women shoppers and shop girls around her."
Sister Carrie,2,9,"She finally manages to tear herself away, and goes to the store's managerial office where a bunch of other girls are waiting to apply for jobs. She eyes the competition and fears they look way more sophisticated than she does. After a nearly hour-long wait, she's interviewed. The interview is short but not sweet, and that pesky ""lack of experience"" thing comes up again."
Sister Carrie,2,10,"Next thing we know, she's out on the street practically in tears, ruminating on the crushing disappointments of the day. Just as she's about to throw in the towel, she comes across a hat-making company with a Help Wanted sign posted out front for ""wrappers and stitchers."""
Sister Carrie,2,11,"She goes inside to find a pretty sorry-looking crowd of laborers; right away, Carrie concludes that this is definitely not her dream job. But when a foreman comes up to her inquiring what she's doing there, Carrie ends up asking if he needs help. He offers to give her a position putting the finishing touches on hats, and just like that she's hired."
Sister Carrie,2,12,"After she leaves, she's not exactly turning cartwheels through the streets of Chicago. She thinks about how pitiful the pay is (""three and a half"" per week. Yup—a whopping $3.50, barely enough to pay for a latte today), and she can't get all of those haggard-looking laborers out of her mind. She figures maybe the solution is to keep looking, so it's back to the job search grind; she tries a few places with no luck, and gets treated rudely to boot."
Sister Carrie,2,13,"Demoralized, Carrie makes one last-ditch effort at a wholesale shoe house (shoe factory). The man she speaks to tells her he's not sure if he can offer her anything, but to come on Monday morning and he'll see if he can find something for her to do. The pay here is a whole dollar more than the other place, so she agrees."
Sister Carrie,2,14,"When Carrie steps outside, Chicago suddenly seems full of lollipops and rainbows. She heads for home to tell Minnie the great news."
Sister Carrie,3,0,"Carrie is already fantasizing about all the stuff she's going to buy with her earnings from the new job, but when she tells Minnie the good news, her sister promptly bursts her bubble by asking if Carrie will have to use part of her earnings to pay for carfare. Gee thanks, sis."
Sister Carrie,3,1,"Mr. Hanson is relieved to hear about Carrie's triumph and his lifted spirits put Minnie in a good mood as the three sit down to dinner. As they merrily eat and converse, Carrie mentions that she'd like to go to a theater downtown to see a show. Weird, awkward silence follows. The narrator lets us know that it's likely the thought of frivolously spending money on something like the theater doesn't sit well with the frugal Mr. Hanson."
Sister Carrie,3,2,"After Mr. Hanson (whose first name we now find out is Sven) retreats to the front room after dinner and the sisters go to work washing the dishes, Carrie presses Minnie about the theater again. She even boldly suggests they go tonight. Minnie won't be persuaded though, and Carrie picks up on the fact that her hesitation is about the money so Carrie offers to pay. Carrie pleads with Minnie to ask Hanson."
Sister Carrie,3,3,"Uh-oh—Carrie's insistence on going to the theater throws up a red flag for Minnie. If she's so ready to waste her money, Minnie and Mr. Hanson are probably never going to see a dime of the board money they all agreed Carrie would pay them when she found a job."
Sister Carrie,3,4,"But, lo and behold, Minnie asks Hanson (albeit half-heartedly) if they can all go to the theater."
Sister Carrie,3,5,"She fails to convince him and Carrie announces she's going to stand ""at the foot of the stairs"" of the apartment building. When she leaves, Mr. Hanson tells Minnie that Carrie shouldn't be wasting money on theater tickets."
Sister Carrie,3,6,"The next night, Carrie goes walking through town by herself to escape the dreariness of Minnie's flat. She looks longingly at all the fancy houses, and her thoughts wander to Drouet. She wonders where he is and now hopes just a little bit that he'll come by on Monday night to liven things up."
Sister Carrie,3,7,"Carrie awakes Monday morning, nervous and excited about her first day on the job, but when she gets to the shoe company, Mr. Brown (the guy who hired her) approaches her like he's never seen her before (so much for a warm welcome). She tells him her name and he leads her through a room of machines, handing her off to the foreman who turns her over to a girl working at a machine."
Sister Carrie,3,8,The girl is instructed to train Carrie to work at a machine that punches shoelace holes in leather.
Sister Carrie,3,9,"The narrator describes the assembly line set-up: ""The pieces of leather came from the girl at the machine to her right, and were passed on to the girl at her left. Carrie saw at once that an average speed was necessary or the work would pile up on her and all those below would be delayed"" (4.72)."
Sister Carrie,3,10,"Carrie gets to work, but she's having trouble keeping up with the fast-paced environment and she gets scolded. The room is stinking hot as the morning wears on and Carrie's back starts aching. The girl next to her tells her she can stand up so she does, but she still can't get quite comfortable. Above the racket of the machines, she listens to the other girls's gossip about guys."
Sister Carrie,3,11,"When the lunch bell finally rings, Carrie drags her weary self into the lunch space. The working conditions in the factory are horrid, with foul smells, littered floors, and no places for employees to take breaks. The narrator reminds us, though, that the novel is set ten years in the past (1889), before the real heyday of labor unions demanding better conditions for workers."
Sister Carrie,3,12,"And then it's high school all over again: Carrie is the new girl who has to find people to sit with in the lunchroom. She just doesn't have the guts to break into any of the cliques so the poor girl ends up going back to her machine to eat alone. As she eats, she listens to teasing flirtations going on between male workers and some of the women and feels a bit turned off by it all."
Sister Carrie,3,13,"After the lunchtime trauma, Carrie is actually glad to get back to work… that is, until she gets poked in the ribs by a smart aleck boy which makes her feel like crying. The girl next to her tries to comfort her, but Carrie can't help feeling like she's not going to last long at this place. The hours crawl by, until finally 6:00PM comes and she leaves (but not before enduring some more unwanted male attention)."
Sister Carrie,39,0,"The next morning, Carrie apologizes to Hurstwood for missing dinner. When he doesn't seem to care, she stops caring, too: ""From now on, her indifference to the flat was even greater"" (40.8)."
Sister Carrie,39,1,"We learn that Hurstwood hates having to ask for money from Carrie so much that he built up a huge debt with the grocer, and instead of paying it off he just switched grocers (and he plays the same trick on the poor butcher and others, too)."
Sister Carrie,39,2,"Carrie and Lola try out for parts with another theater company and they're successful. Carrie's new paycheck is pretty sweet at twenty bucks a week. As Carrie's life seems to be improving though, Hurstwood's is going downhill. He spends his days sitting around rocking, reading the paper, and generally being depressed."
Sister Carrie,39,3,"One day, the grocer shows up at the door wanting his money. Hurstwood tells the grocer he'll pay something toward the debt on Saturday. Carrie is mad that Hurstwood ran up such a big bill and tells him she's not about to pay for it; then she leaves."
Sister Carrie,39,4,"We take a quick hop back in time and learn that Hurstwood had been reading in the papers about a strike that's about to take place among trolley workers in Brooklyn. The strike soon occurs and the trolley company puts an ad in the paper looking for workers (or, really, permanent replacement workers, a.k.a. scabs) to fill the places of the strikers. The ad notes that these workers will be protected by police (take note, the police are protecting the interests of the company). Hurstwood came across the ad during one of his newspaper-reading marathons."
Sister Carrie,39,5,"Now we jump back to the current scene in which Carrie has just stormed out after the grocer came by. Hurstwood is so ashamed that he considers going down to the trolley station to see if he can find work as a scab. He weighs the pros (money) and the cons (possibly being shot by an angry striker), and the next day he decides to go for it. When he tells Carrie what he's doing, she asks if he's afraid (she's read that four men were hurt yesterday), but he brushes it off, telling her that there will be police protection."
Sister Carrie,39,6,Hurstwood goes to the railroad building and sees the strikers. A policeman asks him what he's doing—he tells him he's looking for work and the cop points him toward the offices. The strikers shoot him dirty looks.
Sister Carrie,39,7,"When he gets to the office, Hurstwood asks one of the men if they're hiring. Hurstwood has no experience as a motorman, but they're so desperate for workers that they're willing to train him."
Sister Carrie,38,0,"Carrie really wants to go shopping, and she begins thinking that if only she and Hurstwood didn't have to eat, she'd be the best-dressed woman in all of New York City. Hurstwood informs Carrie that he's officially broke (even though he secretly has set aside ten bucks to spend on himself), and she tells him to take money from her purse for groceries."
Sister Carrie,38,1,"On her way into the theater, Carrie sees another chorus girl decked out in an awesome tweed suit and decides that she will for sure have to go shopping over the weekend."
Sister Carrie,38,2,"We learn that Carrie's made a new friend in the chorus, Lola Osbourne, first referred to as ""the blue-eyed soldier"" because that's the part she has in the play. Lola tells her that they should try out for parts in another show because they're being underpaid."
Sister Carrie,38,3,"Carrie buys shoes, which leaves her without enough for rent; she tells Hurstwood they're short. Hurstwood tells her not to worry—they can wait to pay the grocer. Carrie gets frustrated again that Hurstwood doesn't seem to be in any hurry to get a job, and she starts hanging out more often with Lola (who thinks Carrie's single) to avoid seeing him."
Sister Carrie,38,4,"One night, Hurstwood asks her what she's been up to. Carrie resents his butting into her life, and things between them get even tenser."
Sister Carrie,38,5,"One night at the theater, the manager decides to put Carrie at the head of the chorus line. The new position comes with a raise; she's now making eighteen bucks a week. She decides she's not to spend this money feeding Hurstwood—nope, she's off to the department store instead."
Sister Carrie,38,6,"Carrie spends more than she anticipated during her shopping trip, so it's time to yet again face her money troubles with Hurstwood. She tells him that she just doesn't earn enough to pay all their expenses. Hurstwood's no dummy though, and has seen the clothes she's been buying lately. They argue and Carrie tells Hurstwood—yet again—that he needs to step up the job search. She feels a little bad (Hurstwood was on the verge of tears) afterward, so she cooks dinner for him."
Sister Carrie,38,7,"But the good will doesn't last long, and she's quickly back to thinking that he shouldn't be freeloading. Carrie begins hanging out even more with Lola and some of her guy friends, and one day they invite her to go on a drive. One of the guys takes a liking to Carrie. She stays out so late that she ends up missing dinner with Hurstwood."
Sister Carrie,38,8,"They end up going to a fancy restaurant and this reminds Carrie of Ames, whom she misses. They try to convince her to hang out with them some more, but she turns them down."
Sister Carrie,33,0,"Carrie is pretty upset about her financial situation now that Hurstwood's business has closed down. She's worried she'll have to go back to living on the verge of poverty like she did at her sister's place when she first got to Chicago, though now it's even worse because she's had a taste of the rich life through the Vances."
Sister Carrie,33,1,"Hurstwood tries to find another business to invest in, but doesn't find anything he can afford. To top it off, economic times are suddenly tough all around: the unemployment rate in NYC is skyrocketing due to the Panic of 1893. He tells himself not to worry—he's got enough savings to get by for the next six months—but then he thinks about how Mrs. Hurstwood and his kids are probably living the high life with all of his money, which makes him feel worse again."
Sister Carrie,33,2,"He does more searching for business opportunities, but comes up with nothing so he goes home. Carrie notices how miserable he looks, and it's not a good look for him, she concludes. Too kind, Carrie, too kind."
Sister Carrie,33,3,"They're both in a pretty bad mood, so let the bickering begin. Hurstwood leaves to go downtown. Arguments over money have become routine for Hurstwood and Carrie, and they're not getting along well at all. Carrie, especially, seems to be repelled by Hurstwood."
Sister Carrie,33,4,"Hurstwood's last day at the saloon arrives. He receives a little money from the selling of the saloon's fixtures, and Hurstwood and his partner Shaughnessy part ways with no love lost between them."
Sister Carrie,33,5,"When Hurstwood returns home, Carrie asks if he's going to be able to get something else going. He tells her he'll have to save up first."
Sister Carrie,33,6,"For a while, Hurstwood keeps looking for a business to invest in. When he realizes that's not going to happen until he saves up more money though, he decides he needs to get a job in order to save money (kind of how that works, right?)."
Sister Carrie,33,7,"The problem? The type of job he's qualified for, manager, seems impossible to get: ""The papers contained no requests for managers. Such positions, he knew well enough were either secured by long years of service or were bought with a half or third interest"" (34.78). So in other words, he can't get the manager job unless he buys into the business, but he can't afford to buy into the business without getting a job. Bummer."
Sister Carrie,33,8,"Hurstwood starts to look for work anyway, and as he's walking around downtown, he realizes he has no experience at doing anything else. It gets chilly so he goes into a hotel lobby to sit down for a bit."
Sister Carrie,33,9,"He thinks about maybe applying for a bartender job, but can't bring himself to do it, so he goes home and slumps into the rocking chair. He reads the newspaper as Carrie makes dinner."
Sister Carrie,33,10,Oh and she has some bad news: rent's due.
Sister Carrie,32,0,"Six months pass. Carrie never saw Ames again, but ""she had an ideal to contrast men by—particularly men close to her"" (33.2). Hurstwood's financial situation is okay, though not great (especially when he compares it to his old life of hobnobbing back in Chicago), and his diminished circumstances are taking a toll on his mood and he's becoming depressed."
Sister Carrie,32,1,"Then business at the saloon dies down. He tells Carrie what's going on and she's not happy. Plus, she finds out that the Vances are taking a vacation—she thinks this is unfair, and she cries."
Sister Carrie,32,2,"Hurstwood tells Carrie about more business troubles: His partner Shaughnessy (we now learn the cranky alcoholic's name) won't make any updates to the saloon, and Hurstwood thinks that without some sprucing up, the place will never be profitable. He tells her he's thinking about saving up and opening his own place, and suggests they move to a smaller apartment so they can save more money. She's not happy about the prospect of living in an even smaller apartment, but she agrees to do it."
Sister Carrie,32,3,"They move to their new microscopic apartment, and soon after Hurstwood's business partner tells him that the guy who owns the property on which their business sits (they currently lease the lot from him) has sold it… which means they've gotta leave once their lease is up."
Sister Carrie,32,4,"Hurstwood asks his partner if he thinks they should open up another place in the neighborhood, but his partner doesn't want to (and Hurstwood doesn't have enough money saved yet to open his own place). He realizes not only is he out of a job, he's going to lose the thousand bucks he invested in the place to begin with."
Sister Carrie,32,5,"Hurstwood tries to look for another business opportunity, but doesn't have much luck. He tells Carrie what's going on, and she sees that he's broke."
Sister Carrie,44,0,"Hurstwood's still over at the cheap hotel where we last saw him (it turns out he sold the old furniture to pay for the place). He's been reading about Carrie more in the papers, and he's even seen her on billboards."
Sister Carrie,44,1,"Time rolls on and Hurstwood is forced to go into a lodging house in the Bowery, which is pretty much one step away from living in a homeless shelter. The poor guy seems also to be losing it a little. He daydreams so often about his old life of luxury that he sometimes starts talking out loud as if he is his old self, disturbing the other men in the boarding house."
Sister Carrie,44,2,"Hurstwood tries to find work at another hotel. They don't have anything open, but he's such a sorry sight that they take him in as a kind of charity case, letting him sleep in the attic and giving him food in return for doing a few odd jobs. But then he gets pneumonia and someone from the hotel takes him to the hospital where he stays for three weeks."
Sister Carrie,44,3,"When he gets out, he's got no money and nowhere to go so he starts begging for change. He's ashamed, but desperate."
Sister Carrie,44,4,"He's become so desperate in fact that he decides to go to the theater where he knows Carrie is performing. He hovers around the entrance, hoping to run into her, but he doesn't find her. Nearby, there's a man who we come to know as the captain, a man described as ""an ex-soldier turned religionist."" The captain collects money from strangers on the street in order to help homeless people find beds for the night."
Sister Carrie,44,5,"A crowd forms around him, and Hurstwood drifts into the crowd. The captain collects enough money and then leads them to a boarding house for the night."
Sister Carrie,44,6,"As Hurstwood climbs into his bunk at the boarding house, he realizes he's starving."
Sister Carrie,45,0,"Carrie's in her dressing room when she hears ""a familiar voice."""
Sister Carrie,45,1,"No, it's not Hurstwood. It's a blast from her past: Drouet. Remember him?"
Sister Carrie,45,2,"He's stopping by to congratulate Carrie on her success, and invites her to come out with him and his friend. She declines, but invites him to dinner the next night at her latest pad: the Waldorf, a super fancy famous hotel in NYC."
Sister Carrie,45,3,"Drouet and Carrie meet up for lunch. When Drouet asks about Hurstwood. Carrie only says that she thinks he's still in New York. Drouet fills her in about Hurstwood having stolen the money back in Chicago, and she's shocked. Hearing the news actually makes her feel sorry for Hurstwood."
Sister Carrie,45,4,"Drouet flirts a bit with Carrie, trying to rekindle their flame, but she's not having it and she leaves. The next night on her way into the theater, Carrie runs smack into Hurstwood, who's hanging around waiting for her. She hardly recognizes him because he looks so bad, and when he asks for money, she immediately gives it to him."
Sister Carrie,45,5,She asks what's wrong with him and he says that he's been sick and that he's living in a room in the Bowery. Then he leaves.
Sister Carrie,45,6,Carrie becomes withdrawn. The show she's starring in gets transferred to London and it looks like she's setting off for England—cheerio.
Sister Carrie,45,7,"Months pass, during which Hurstwood continues to suffer homelessness and Carrie returns from London to New York to appear in a new Broadway play."
Sister Carrie,45,8,"And Ames is back, and he and Mrs. Vance (they're cousins, remember) go to see Carrie in a play. But Carrie is no longer romantically interested in Ames. She seems to still be pretty influenced by his opinions, though, and he tells her that she would be better off doing comedy-dramas than comedies (what she's been doing) because she's more suited to that genre. Carrie tells Lola—surprise, surprise—that she wants to start doing drama."
Sister Carrie,34,0,"Hurstwood decides to apply for a salesman position at a whiskey company, but his attitude puts off his potential employer (he can tell this job is likely not Hurstwood's first choice or even fifth choice). He almost applies for another job in a furniture company, but decides against it."
Sister Carrie,34,1,"After stopping for lunch at a restaurant, he thinks about where he's going to try to find work next. He goes into another hotel lobby and sits by the window and watches street life—seeing all the displays of wealth is really a downer right about now."
Sister Carrie,34,2,"When he gets back to the apartment, Hurstwood paints a rosy picture for Carrie of his job prospects, hinting that he's likely going to get the job at the liquor company. Then he plops down in the rocker and reads the paper (déjà vu)."
Sister Carrie,34,3,"The next day Hurstwood can't think of anywhere else to apply for a job even though he feels like he should go out and look. Carrie reminds him that he needs to give her money for their weekly expenses (twelve bucks—practically a fortune); annoyed, he forks it over."
Sister Carrie,34,4,"Hurstwood leaves and heads for the hotel lobby. He gets a shave at their barbershop, then turns around and goes right back home, depressed and disgusted. This goes on for several days until a winter storm descends and Hurstwood isn't able to go out for the next three days. He settles in to rock it out in the rocker and read the paper—Carrie's not too pleased that he seems so comfortable loafing around."
Sister Carrie,34,5,"When the storm clears, Hurstwood heads downtown, intending to check out a business opportunity advertised in the paper, but then he thinks it'll probably be useless so he goes to his favorite haunt, the hotel lobby. While he's in the lobby, an acquaintance of his from back in Chicago, Mr. Cargill, spots him. They make small talk, but it's really awkward."
Sister Carrie,34,6,"Hurstwood leaves the hotel and wanders around, trying to think of someplace to go. He finally goes home—it's only 2:45 and Carrie's there. Ugh."
Sister Carrie,34,7,"He comes down with a cold that night and stays in bed for the next few days. Carrie is none too thrilled about playing the role of his nursemaid. After he recovers, Hurstwood tries to look for work a few more times, but then pretty much decides to give up for the rest of the winter."
Sister Carrie,34,8,"With all his hanging around the apartment, he begins to notice that Carrie isn't the greatest with money, so he gets an idea: he'll take over the shopping. But this means that he stops giving her money, which makes her utterly miserable."
Sister Carrie,34,9,"Plus, to save money Hurstwood stops getting shaves, which is a real turn-off for Carrie. And she's fed up that he's not even trying to look for a job anymore. Carrie starts sleeping in a separate room."
Sister Carrie,35,0,"We get an update on Carrie's old pal, Mrs. Vance."
Sister Carrie,35,1,"It turns out that Carrie never sent Mrs. Vance her new address (remember that Mrs. V was on vacation when Carrie moved) because she was ashamed about having to move to a smaller place. Mrs. V just figured she moved out of town, so she's pretty surprised when she runs into Carrie out shopping."
Sister Carrie,35,2,"Carrie plays it off like she'd been planning to get in touch, and tells Mrs. Vance to come see her and gives her the new address. Mrs. Vance takes one glance at it and knows immediately that she and Hurstwood must be having financial troubles."
Sister Carrie,35,3,"At home, Carrie finds an unshaven Hurstwood in his usual spot. That night at dinner she tells him about meeting Mrs. Vance. They bicker about—what else?—money. Hurstwood has started playing poker downtown. At first he won a little, but then his luck ran out and he lost big time."
Sister Carrie,35,4,"A few days later, Hurstwood is hanging around in his old dingy clothes while Carrie is out. Knock, knock—it's Mrs. Vance dropping by to see Carrie. She's astonished to find Hurstwood in such bad shape. He invites her in, but she declines in a hurry, given that he looks like something that crawled out of the swamp."
Sister Carrie,35,5,"When Carrie gets home and finds out Mrs. Vance stopped by, she's totally appalled that she saw Hurstwood looking so bad. They begin fighting and Carrie tells him he needs to find a job. Why did he even marry her, she wants to know, if he didn't expect to take care of her?"
Sister Carrie,35,6,"And then he drops a major bomb: ""I didn't marry you,"" he tells her."
Sister Carrie,35,7,"Apparently their marriage wasn't legal after all, but there's not much further explanation. Carrie is furious and bursts into tears; Hurstwood gets dressed and leaves. He goes to a fancy hotel and blows money on an expensive dinner, and then he decides to give poker another try. Bad idea—he loses. A lot."
Sister Carrie,35,8,"He goes back to the apartment. Throughout the next few days, Hurstwood ""lived like a gentleman,"" meaning he wasted money on a bunch of stuff he couldn't afford."
Sister Carrie,35,9,"When Carrie tells him that the rent's due, he realizes he's down to his last hundred bucks."
Sister Carrie,43,0,"Carrie gets her very own dressing room, which is a huge step up in the showbiz world."
Sister Carrie,43,1,"A representative from the Wellington, a fancy hotel, shows up at Carrie's apartment and convinces her to take some rooms in the place for the summer (he's eager to have her as a guest to bring publicity to the hotel). Carrie insists she'll need to bring Lola along and the guy says that's okay. He shows them the rooms, and they are ultra-posh. Carrie and Lola agree to take them and move in immediately."
Sister Carrie,43,2,"One day while Carrie's in her dressing room at the theater, Mrs. Vance stops by. She's read the papers and found out what a big star her old pal Carrie has become. They catch up a little and Mrs. Vance invites her to come over the next day. It dawns on Carrie that ""she was as good as this woman now—perhaps better"" (44.23)."
Sister Carrie,43,3,"Carrie is inundated with fan mail from rich men wanting to marry her (""mash notes,"" as they're called), and Lola can't understand why Carrie doesn't want to meet any of these rich dudes in person."
Sister Carrie,43,4,"Carrie gets her first really big paycheck: $150. She's thrilled to be raking it in now, as she thinks back to earlier days when she was only making a pittance."
Sister Carrie,43,5,"But things aren't perfect: Carrie is lonely, as she tells Lola, but Lola tells her she just needs to go out more."
Sister Carrie,42,0,"Carrie's settling into her new digs and wondering what Hurstwood is thinking about her departure. She goes to the theater and fears he might be there, but he's not. She remains scared for the next few days that he might show up at the theater, but he doesn't and the fear passes."
Sister Carrie,42,1,"Carrie has been reading ""the theatrical papers,"" which are basically the late nineteenth century's version of celebrity-obsessed magazines like US Weekly or People. She thinks it would be awesome to open up one of these magazines and see herself mentioned someday."
Sister Carrie,42,2,"And then one day, she does. Okay, it's not a five-page spread or anything—just a couple of lines announcing her part as a country maid in ""The Wives of Abdul""—but she's totally psyched."
Sister Carrie,42,3,"She's also super happy that she can spend all of the money she earns on clothes, fancy food, and pimping out her new room. Plus, thanks to her rising-star status, she's suddenly surrounded by new friends and dudes who can't wait to take her out."
Sister Carrie,42,4,And then—oh my—Carrie's picture turns up in one of the theatrical papers. She's going to have to hold back the paparazzi now.
Sister Carrie,42,5,"But there's trouble in paradise as Carrie realizes that while she may have the equivalent of a thousand Twitter followers, she has no real companionship."
Sister Carrie,42,6,"The show Carrie's in is about to go on the road, but Lola convinces her that going on the road is a bad idea and that they'd be better off auditioning for another local show. They audition and get the parts. Carrie's role is pretty small, but she makes the most of it and becomes an audience favorite. This seems to backfire though: she ends up stealing the show and one of the hotshot stars of the play threatens to quit if the manager doesn't fire her."
Sister Carrie,42,7,"The manager likes Carrie's performance so much that he keeps her, though, and she gets more publicity in the papers. The manager is so thrilled that he gives her a song to sing in the production and a big time raise (one hundred and fifty bucks)."
Sister Carrie,42,8,"Abruptly shifting gears, we switch over to Hurstwood, who is now living in ""a third-rate Bleecker Street hotel""… which is about as bad as it sounds. He's been reading about Carrie in the paper, but you won't find him hunting her down for a piece of the action. No sir—despite his financial woes, his pride kicks in and he resolves not to bug her."
Sister Carrie,29,0,"Hurstwood begins to think an expensive city like New York isn't such a great place to be if you're not filthy rich. Despite his financial woes though, he and Carrie find a nice apartment with a sweet view of Central Park. Carrie complains about how small it is compared to where she lived in Chicago, but so it goes in NYC."
Sister Carrie,29,1,Hurstwood sets about looking for business opportunities. He ends up finding work managing a local saloon (oh yeah—and he also invests a thousand dollars for part ownership of the business).
Sister Carrie,29,2,"At first he's pretty stoked about having gotten his new career going, however things sour pretty quickly. His alcoholic business partner is cranky and Hurstwood doesn't really care for the saloon's sub-par clientele. Plus, the business doesn't pay as much as he expected."
Sister Carrie,29,3,"About a month after getting the job, Carrie announces she's going to buy a dress. He asks her if she can wait because money is a little tight. She agrees to hold off, but thinks it's a little weird since he never had money troubles before. She starts to notice other signs of financial problems and grows uneasy."
Sister Carrie,29,4,"On top of his money troubles, Hurstwood lives in fear of running into someone he knew from his old life. He recalls a time in which he ran into someone on the street who promised to stop into his saloon but then never did. He also sees trouble on the horizon in his marriage so long as money problems persist."
Sister Carrie,28,0,"Still rolling along, Carrie gazes out the train's window. Forgetting all about having essentially been kidnapped by Hurstwood, she starts getting excited about the journey."
Sister Carrie,28,1,"The next morning, they arrive in Montreal and go straight to a fancy hotel. Hurstwood signs in with a fake last name and his real initials (G.W.)."
Sister Carrie,28,2,"Once inside their room, Hurstwood begs Carrie to marry him. She has mixed feelings—on the one hand, he's still a creep for deceiving her; but on the other hand, she's pretty much got nobody else."
Sister Carrie,28,3,They end up kissing and then she asks him if he'll marry her. He replies that he'll do it today. He tells her to get ready—he'll be back in less than an hour.
Sister Carrie,28,4,"Hurstwood goes to the lobby in search of a barbershop, feeling like everything's just hunky-dory now. Until he hears a familiar voice."
Sister Carrie,28,5,"Oh, no—it's one of his business friends, Kenny. He's surprised to see Hurstwood, who explains that he's there attending to ""a little private matter."" Kenny invites him for a drink later and he says okay."
Sister Carrie,28,6,"Seeing Kenny reminds Hurstwood of his crime, and he worries about whether the newspapers have broken the story yet."
Sister Carrie,28,7,"Hurstwood decides to go back up and get Carrie to take her to have breakfast at another hotel. But on his way, he notices some dude watching him. It's got to be a detective, he thinks. Let the paranoia begin."
Sister Carrie,28,8,"Carrie's looking all fresh and ready to go by the time Hurstwood gets back up to the room. She's not exactly overflowing with love though, which makes him feel worse."
Sister Carrie,28,9,"Hurstwood and Carrie leave the hotel, and on their way to breakfast Hurstwood sees that same dude who he thinks is a detective."
Sister Carrie,28,10,"At the restaurant, Carrie tells Hurstwood that she's not digging Montreal—the place seems pretty dead. He tells her they don't have to stay long and tries to cheer her up with the promise of a shopping trip that afternoon. He tells her they'll be heading to New York soon."
Sister Carrie,28,11,"They go back to the hotel and Hurstwood figures he better try to find a paper to see if he's front-page news yet. He leaves Carrie in the room and goes to get a paper. The story is there, but it's not featured prominently. He feels very regretful about what he's done."
Sister Carrie,28,12,"He goes back upstairs to get Carrie and is about to talk to her when (dun, dun, dun) there's a knock at the door."
Sister Carrie,28,13,It's the detective dude. Uh-oh—Hurstwood steps into the hall.
Sister Carrie,28,14,Evidently Hurstwood wasn't just being paranoid: this guy really is a detective. But Hurstwood is cool as a cucumber.
Sister Carrie,28,15,"The detective asks him if he plans to keep the stolen money, and Hurstwood tells him ""I know just what you can do and what you can't"" and says that he's already written to his bosses to settle the situation."
Sister Carrie,28,16,Hurstwood goes back into the room. Carrie asks who the guy was and Hurstwood tells her it was some buddy of his from Chicago.
Sister Carrie,28,17,"He thinks about his plan to write to his employers to explain what happened and then send the money back. Not such a bad idea, he concludes. He hopes they'll forgive him and take him back."
Sister Carrie,28,18,"He writes the letter and sends it, figuring he won't send the money yet until he hears back from them."
Sister Carrie,28,19,"Feeling insecure, he asks Carrie if she'll stay with him. Carrie now feels sorry for him and says yes, but only on the condition that they get married. He says he'll get a license under a different name—Wheeler (she nixes his first name choice of Murdock). The ensuing wedding doesn't exactly sound like a dream: ""They were married by a Baptist minister, the first divine they found convenient"" (29.135)."
Sister Carrie,28,20,"Hurstwood hears back from his employers. They're shocked at what he did, but if he returns the money, they won't prosecute. Whew—what a relief. But his employers aren't sure about the idea of him coming back to work. They'll get back to him on that one."
Sister Carrie,28,21,"He's bummed. He pays them back almost everything he owes, pocketing a bit for himself. He tells Carrie to pack up and has her trunk sent to the train station with instructions to get it to NYC. Despite the communication with his employers, he's still afraid a police officer might be on his trail as he heads out of Canada to New York."
Sister Carrie,28,22,They ride into New York and Carrie's entranced by the place.
Sister Carrie,28,23,"When they get into Grand Central Station, Hurstwood pretty much leaves Carrie in the dust as he makes a beeline for the street, still fearing he might be arrested at any moment. Carrie catches up with him and he hails them a cab—for the first time, he starts worrying about how much it's going to cost him."
Sister Carrie,28,24,"Hurstwood tells Carrie they should go apartment hunting right away, and he tells the cab driver to take him to a hotel where he's less likely to be seen by anyone he knows."
Sister Carrie,28,25,"Carrie asks Hurstwood where the ""Residence part"" of New York is and he tells her this isn't the kind of place with big houses and picket fences. She doesn't like the sound of that."
Sister Carrie,17,0,"Hurstwood has been talking up the play to a bunch of his businessmen buds, convincing them to get tickets—he's even taken out an ad in the newspaper. This thing is going to be more packed than a Madonna concert."
Sister Carrie,17,1,"Carrie is jittery as the big night approaches, even though she has prepared thoroughly. A member of the cast has been axed for his lackluster performance and replaced by ""a loafing professional,"" and Mrs. Morgan is still green with envy over Carrie's favored status."
Sister Carrie,17,2,"The lodge sends a carriage to pick up Carrie and Drouet and bring them to the theater. Carrie gets her makeup done and is soon transformed into ""The Belle of Society."" She adores the whole process and atmosphere."
Sister Carrie,17,3,"The theater lobby is jammed with well-dressed, well-to-do businessmen and their families. Hurstwood and Drouet run into each other in the lobby and greet one another. Hurstwood chats with his pals, and when one asks where his wife is, Hurstwood (liar, liar) says she's sick."
Sister Carrie,16,0,Carrie writes to Hurstwood telling him about getting the part in the play. He writes back telling her to meet him in the park the next day so he can hear more about it.
Sister Carrie,16,1,"When they meet up, he insists on coming to see her debut. She's hesitant, but Hurstwood tells her not to worry and that he'll arrange it so that Drouet doesn't know it was Carrie who told him about it. Hurstwood can see that Carrie is super psyched about the play."
Sister Carrie,16,2,"A few days later, Drouet and Hurstwood run into each other at a bar and Hurstwood tells him that he's heard about the play. Drouet asks how he heard and Hurstwood tells him the lodge sent him some tickets (Hurstwood is also an Elk, by the way)."
Sister Carrie,16,3,Drouet tells him Carrie's going to be in it and Hustwood plays dumb and acts surprised. They agree that she'll do a good job and Hurstwood promises to take them out to dinner after the show.
Sister Carrie,16,4,"Carrie attends her first play rehearsal run by Mr. Quincel, who is assisted by Mr. Millice. Millice thinks he's a big shot because he's had a little acting experience. You fancy, huh?"
Sister Carrie,16,5,"Mr. Millice is none too pleased with most of these amateur actors' performances, but he's very impressed with Carrie. The director asks Carrie if she's had experience acting before—she's so good—which makes another actress, Mrs. Morgan, super jealous."
Sister Carrie,16,6,"Carrie goes home, excited to tell Drouet about the successful rehearsal, but Drouet really doesn't seem to care too much. This just makes her even more eager to sneak off to see Hurstwood."
Sister Carrie,16,7,"She meets up with Hurstwood, who is excited for her and says he plans to sneak into a rehearsal to see her; she begs him not to. They part ways and Carrie is all smiles."
Sister Carrie,23,0,Hurstwood is staying in a hotel. He's all worried about what his wife is going to do and fears that he might lose his job and his friends if news of his indiscretions gets around. Plus he's worried about losing his money and property since a lot of it is in Mrs. Hurstwood's name.
Sister Carrie,23,1,His only comfort is thinking of how great things are going with Carrie (little does he know...).
Sister Carrie,23,2,"Hurstwood checks his mail, eats breakfast, and goes to meet Carrie at the park. He waits for an hour but she still doesn't show. His mind races—he's worried that Mrs. H has somehow found her and told her that he's married."
Sister Carrie,23,3,"He leaves the park to go back to work and it starts to rain, adding to his gloom."
Sister Carrie,23,4,"Back at work, Hurstwood can barely concentrate. He goes to lunch and when he returns, a messenger delivers him a letter from Mrs. H. It says to give money to the messenger to give to her. Nice try—he refuses and the messenger leaves."
Sister Carrie,23,5,"A few hours later, he gets another note from Mrs. H telling him that if he doesn't give her the money by tonight, she's going to tell his employers about the affair tomorrow."
Sister Carrie,23,6,"He takes a cab to his house, but discovers that his key won't work. He rings the doorbell and gets no answer."
Sister Carrie,23,7,"Fuming, he gets back in the cab."
Sister Carrie,22,0,Carrie's having second thoughts about the whole running-away-with-Hurstwood idea—she feels like it might be wrong to ditch Drouet.
Sister Carrie,22,1,"Carrie straightens up her room, and when Drouet comes home, he's all set to ask her about Hurstwood. He finds it hard to actually ask her what's going on though, and when he finally works up the nerve to tell her what the maid said, she just denies it."
Sister Carrie,22,2,Drouet tells her to stay away from Hurstwood because he's a married man.
Sister Carrie,22,3,What? Carrie is aghast. Hurstwood lied to her.
Sister Carrie,22,4,"But who does she get mad at? Drouet, of course. He introduced Hurstwood to her in the first place, after all, she thinks. Drouet lets Carrie know that she's the one in the wrong for having betrayed him after he's done so much for her, but she's all I never asked you for any of it and tells him she's leaving."
Sister Carrie,22,5,"Drouet says, wait, no, he'll go—she can stay the whole month if she wants, and decide what to do. He secretly hopes the whole thing will all blow over by then."
Sister Carrie,22,6,"As Drouet packs, Carrie thinks about what a jerk Hurstwood is for having lied to her, and resolves not to see him again."
Sister Carrie,22,7,"Drouet offers to help Carrie with her acting career and give her some money. Then he asks if she's really that into Hurstwood, but she gets mad and doesn't want to talk about it."
Sister Carrie,22,8,"He tells her that she needs to choose between the two of them. He gets angry and storms out after telling her ""You can go to the deuce as far as I am concerned"" (23.142). Whoa."
Sister Carrie,5,0,"Carrie returns to her sister's flat and reports to Minnie and Mr. Hanson that her new job stinks; unsurprisingly, they're not particularly sympathetic. This bums Carrie out further. She realizes Minnie and Mr. Hanson just don't get her, and that she's really starting to loathe life in their apartment."
Sister Carrie,5,1,"Then it dawns on her that Drouet might disregard her warning and show up tonight. Oh, geez—What's she going do if that happens? She decides to preempt any trouble by hanging out again at ""the foot of the stairs"" (which seems like the main doorway of the apartment) in case he shows."
Sister Carrie,5,2,"The minute she leaves, Minnie and her husband start talking about her. Mr. Hanson stresses how important it is for Carrie to keep her job at the factory, adding that she probably shouldn't be standing down by the door because ""it doesn't look good."" Meanwhile, Carrie enjoys checking out the street action downstairs."
Sister Carrie,5,3,"Using the excuse that he's going out to get a loaf of bread, Hanson leaves the apartment. Yup—he's actually trying to spy on Carrie, but she knows it. And she doesn't like it."
Sister Carrie,5,4,"Drouet's a no-show, so Carrie goes back upstairs and hits the hay."
Sister Carrie,5,5,"Her second day at the factory is just about as bad as the first one, and Carrie gets yelled at by the foreman for going too slowly. She's still not fitting in with her new coworkers either, and really hates the ""rude banter"" between the girls and the guys; she is totally grossed out when one of the guys starts verbally harassing her."
Sister Carrie,5,6,"Déjà vu time—life at Chez Hanson that night is so unbearable that Carrie returns to her favorite hang-out—that's right, the ever-exciting apartment doorway. This time though, she has a creepy encounter with a dude passing by on the street who seems to want to take her for a stroll. For once she's glad to return to the flat."
Sister Carrie,5,7,"The rest of the work week follows suit with the first two days, and then—to add insult to injury—one morning it starts to rain and Carrie realizes she has no umbrella. But wait—it gets worse: Minnie lends Carrie a faded umbrella, and horrified, Carrie rushes to the department store to buy a more suitable one, which of course leads to a bicker-fest with Minnie."
Sister Carrie,5,8,"A few nights later, Carrie forks over to Minnie the money she'd promised to pay for board (four whole dollars). Minnie feels a little guilty taking it, but pockets it anyway, and Carrie is left wondering how on earth she's going amuse herself with the two quarters she's got left. She gets snippy with Minnie and Hanson, telling them she's going out because she wants to see something, and as usual, they start talking about her the moment she leaves."
Sister Carrie,5,9,"She ends up going to… you guessed it, the bottom of the stairs. But the next day, she ventures out to a park. She's not happy with that, though, because she realizes she hates her clothes. During the next few days at work, Carrie overhears girls chatting about how much of their paycheck they get to spend on themselves."
Sister Carrie,5,10,"When Carrie goes home and complains to Minnie about needing winter clothes, Minnie is actually cool about it and tells her to keep more of her paycheck to spruce up her wardrobe."
Sister Carrie,5,11,"Everything's coming up roses it seems… well, not quite."
Sister Carrie,5,12,"Just as Carrie's about to go on her shopping spree, she catches a bad cold. She ends up so sick that she can't work for three days, which causes her to lose her job. Yikes."
Sister Carrie,5,13,"And it's back to job hunting. This time things seem even worse, but on her fourth day, her luck takes a turn for the better. No, she doesn't get a job, silly…"
Sister Carrie,5,14,She runs smack into Drouet. Suddenly she's all tingles and he's just as thrilled to see her; he invites her to lunch at a fancy restaurant.
Sister Carrie,5,15,"Carrie's not sure what to order and is a little freaked out by the prices (seventy-five cents for chicken), but no worries—Drouet steps in to order for her."
Sister Carrie,5,16,"Carrie fills him in on what she's been up to since arriving. She covers all the highlights, er, lowlights: working a miserable job and getting sick. Drouet is astonished to hear that she's been working in the shoe factory and assures her she's way too good to be working there."
Sister Carrie,5,17,The food rocks. And she and Drouet seem to have some major chemistry.
Sister Carrie,5,18,"Drouet tries to convince her to abandon the job search. He has a much better idea about what she should be doing with her time: going to the theater with him tonight. But Carrie hesitates. Ah, Drouet sees what's going on: she needs money."
Sister Carrie,5,19,"And that's where his wallet comes in. He hands her some cash and tells her to get some clothes. She protests a little at first, but… oh, those dollars in her hand feel so good (twenty bucks—a serious jackpot). He assures her it's just a loan, and then he suddenly turns psychic and tells her that he knows she doesn't want to live with her sister; he suggests that she come and meet him tomorrow to check out the matinee."
Sister Carrie,5,20,Carrie feels like her nightmare has just turned to a dream.
Sister Carrie,4,0,We shift gears to find out what Drouet's been up to.
Sister Carrie,4,1,"After getting Carrie's letter, he pretty much put her out of his mind. He hasn't wasted any time jumping back into the Chicago nightlife scene of dining, drinking, and smoking in fancy restaurants and saloons, and he's always on the lookout for opportunities to brush shoulders with local celebrities and other successful men in the community."
Sister Carrie,4,2,"In fact, he's recently become pals with one of those successful men, Mr. G.W. Hurstwood, manager of a fancy hotel called Fitzgerald and Moy's. According to Drouet, he's ""someone worth knowing."""
Sister Carrie,4,3,"We learn that Hurstwood is impressed with Drouet's friendliness, so it seems they've got a bit of a bromance going on. They hang out at a bar and catch up a bit, when Jules Wallace, a famous spiritualist, walks in. Drouet and Hurstwood are both a little star struck."
Sister Carrie,4,4,"Drouet mentions that he has plans to see a play called The Hole in the Ground (that sounds like an exciting one); Hurstwood tells him he'd better get moving because it's getting late, but invites him to find him after the show. He mysteriously adds that he has something to show him."
Sister Carrie,4,5,"As Drouet leaves, he tells Hurstwood about having met Carrie and how he intends to hang out with her before he leaves the city for work. He really talks her up to Hurstwood."
Sister Carrie,30,0,"Despite living on a tighter budget, married life is going pretty well for Carrie. She enjoys going all Martha Stewart and doing domestic tasks like cooking dinner each night. A whole year passes (in the course of a few paragraphs), and in the following year Hurstwood's business picks up and he starts going out alone more, skipping his dinners with Carrie. After the third time he does this, Carrie is peeved… but not devastated, because she's not so into Hurstwood anymore."
Sister Carrie,30,1,"In fact, Carrie's even making some new friends. She strikes up a friendship with Mrs. Vance, a woman who recently moved in across the hall with her husband. One night, Mrs. V invites Carrie and Hurstwood to come over to play cards and meet Mr. Vance. Carrie warns them that Hurstwood is going to be late."
Sister Carrie,30,2,"Carrie and the Vances play cards and Hurstwood later shows up. Carrie notices that she's looking a little shabby compared to the fashion plate Mrs. Vance, and this seriously bums her out."
Sister Carrie,30,3,"One morning, Mrs. Vance invites Carrie to go to the theater—again, Carrie is super jealous of Mrs. V's outfit and accessories. As the two ladies stroll down Broadway, they find themselves in the midst of something of an impromptu fashion parade with ladies and gents all checking out each other's outfits."
Sister Carrie,30,4,Carrie likes the attention until she realizes that—eek—she's the worst-dressed of everyone.
Sister Carrie,30,5,"Now she wants to get out of there in a hurry, though she's eager to return when she's looking better."
Sister Carrie,31,0,"We're reminded that Carrie loves the theater and told that she still thinks a lot about her stage debut back in Chicago. The play Carrie and Mrs. Vance go to see is basically about rich people suffering heartbreak and jealousy, and seeing the luxurious world portrayed on stage further stirs Carrie's desire for expensive stuff."
Sister Carrie,31,1,"After seeing all the displays of wealth on the street and at the theater, going back to her apartment makes Carrie think about how deprived she is. She starts daydreaming about how much she wants to get back into acting. Needless to say, when Hurstwood comes home he finds Carrie in a sour mood."
Sister Carrie,31,2,"In an effort to cheer her up, Hurstwood asks her if she wants to go to the theater. She tells him she's already gone that afternoon, but then after eating dinner, she changes her mind. They go to the theater and Carrie again becomes dissatisfied with her own life as she looks at more spectacles of wealth."
Sister Carrie,31,3,"Fast forward a month: Mrs. Vance invites Carrie to dinner at a fancy restaurant and then to the theater with her and Mr. Vance on a night when Hurstwood has other dinner plans. Mrs. Vance has become Carrie's fashion guru, encouraging her to buy more and more stuff, which is starting to bother Hurstwood. And the fact that he's bothered annoys Carrie who feels like he's neglecting her needs."
Sister Carrie,31,4,"Carrie gets ready to go to the theater with Mr. and Mrs. Vance. They meet up and Mr. V tells her to write a note to Hurstwood letting him know where they are in case he gets back. Carrie goes back to her apartment to write the note, and when she returns to the Vance's' apartment she finds a surprise: Mrs. Vance's cousin, Bob Ames, who's visiting from Indianapolis."
Sister Carrie,31,5,"As the two chat, Carrie thinks that not only is this Ames dude smokin' hot, he seems like a sweet, genuine guy. Uh-oh…"
Sister Carrie,31,6,"They all get ready to leave and Mrs. Vance tells Ames he'll have to ""look after"" Carrie. Stirring up trouble much, Mrs. V?"
Sister Carrie,31,7,"On the ride over to the restaurant, Carrie and Ames chat some more about what a cool city NYC is. Ames has a job with an electrical company. As they head into the restaurant, Carrie again notices all the signs of wealth around her. She's extremely impressed with how fancy the restaurant is—this kind of place is way beyond Hurstwood's means now—and she thinks about how lucky Mrs. Vance is."
Sister Carrie,31,8,"Mr. Vance orders a ton of fancy, expensive food (oysters and roast meats… nom nom nom) and wine for everyone. Carrie admires Ames as they eat, and then Ames announces that he sometimes thinks that rich people showing off their money like this is actually kind of gross."
Sister Carrie,31,9,"Carrie's intrigued and wants to hear more (this idea of his never occurred to her), but Mr. and Mrs. Vance say that they think rich people should do whatever they want with their money, which pretty much shuts down that discussion."
Sister Carrie,31,10,"The subject shifts to the latest bestseller, Moulding a Maiden by Albert Ross. Mrs. Vance thinks it's good, Carrie hasn't read it, and Ames thinks it's nearly as bad as Dora Thorne, which totally offends Carrie because she had read that one and thought it was okay. Nevertheless, Carrie is impressed that Ames seems so smart—way smarter than either Drouet or Hurstwood."
Sister Carrie,31,11,"Ames tells Carrie he doesn't care about being rich and drops that old cliché ""money can't buy happiness."" She's skeptical, but plays along like she agrees."
Sister Carrie,31,12,"They all leave the restaurant and go to the theater. During the play, Ames tells Carrie he loves the theater, which makes her want to revive her acting career even more."
Sister Carrie,31,13,"When the show ends, Carrie finds out that Ames isn't returning to the apartment with them. Bummer. It's a lonely ride back without him."
Sister Carrie,31,14,Carrie returns to her apartment to find Hurstwood already in bed. She can't bring herself to get into the bed with him so she goes to the dining room to curl up in the rocking chair and think.
Sister Carrie,46,0,"Things are still going very badly for Hurstwood (hope you've still got the Kleenex handy), and he's living on the streets and eating at soup kitchens run by charities. He begs for money, but most people shy away from him or berate him, telling him ""you're no good."" Police shoo him away."
Sister Carrie,46,1,"Hurstwood considers using the money he's begged for to rent a small room in the boarding house and turn on the gas to kill himself, but he decides not to."
Sister Carrie,46,2,"He sees Carrie on a huge poster and decides to go to the theater to ask her for money. He tries to get into the theater, but a man there kicks him out before he can get to Carrie, so he goes back out on the street. It looks like a blizzard is about to hit."
Sister Carrie,46,3,"We shift to Carrie, in her ""comfortable chambers at the Waldorf."" How's that for contrast? She's reading a book Ames recommended, Père Goriot; she's very impressed. Carrie goes over to the window—the snow is really coming down out there—and Lola says she hopes that there'll be enough snow for a sleigh ride. Carrie (influenced by her recent reading of Père Goriot, we're told) chastises her for being so trivial and not bothering to feel ""sorry for the people who haven't anything to-night."""
Sister Carrie,46,4,"We then catch up with Drouet, who's just arrived at a nice hotel. He's up to his old tricks, trying to pick up women."
Sister Carrie,46,5,Then we're suddenly in a train car with Mrs. Hurstwood and daughter Jessica. Wow—this is beginning to feel like that part after the end of a movie when we find out what happened to all the minor characters as the credits roll.
Sister Carrie,46,6,"Mrs. Hurstwood and Jessica are accompanied by Jessica's new (and, of course, rich) husband. They're starting out on their way to Rome."
Sister Carrie,46,7,"And then we circle back to Hurstwood, who's standing in a crowd of men in the Bowery outside a building in front of a closed door in the freezing cold. The door opens and we see that the place is a boarding house. Hurstwood goes in and pays for a room…"
Sister Carrie,46,8,"When he gets to the room, he puts his stuff down. Then he turns on the gas and lies down."
Sister Carrie,46,9,"We shift to Carrie. She's still rich, famous, and lonely. Really lonely. Her favorite thing to do lately is to sit in a rocking chair and spend her time ""singing and dreaming."" Even Drouet has given up on trying to hang out with her."
Sister Carrie,46,10,"Hurstwood's suicide attempt was successful, and we're told ""[Carrie] was not even aware."""
Sister Carrie,46,11,"As the book ends, we leave Carrie in her rocking chair by the window."
Sister Carrie,27,0,"Carrie pumps Hurstwood for details about Drouet's accident as they're in the cab, but he's pretty vague on these given that he made the story up. He tells her they're headed to the South Side and will have to take the train to get there."
Sister Carrie,27,1,They get to the train station and Hurstwood leaves Carrie in the waiting room while he goes and buys two tickets to Detroit.
Sister Carrie,27,2,"They board the train and settle in. Hurstwood, who's growing more sober by the minute, thinks about what a drunken idiot he was to take the money. For her part, Carrie thinks about how long this trip is taking. She grows more suspicious, and finally comes out and asks Hurstwood if they're really going to see Drouet. He confesses that he lied about Drouet to get her on the train and tells her that he's taking her to a different city."
Sister Carrie,27,3,"Carrie freaks out and tells him she wants to get off the train immediately. She tries to get up, but he gently pushes her down; she's sobbing as he tries to tell her what's going on. She won't listen and threatens to tell the conductor. Hurstwood tells her she can get off at the next station if she wants, but to please listen to what he has to say first."
Sister Carrie,27,4,"Hurstwood tells her that it's over with his wife and that's why he came to get her. She's still steaming mad that he lied to her about Drouet being hurt and everything else though, so she gets up and moves to another seat. He follows."
Sister Carrie,27,5,"He's getting a divorce, he tells her. Plus, he loves her. Carrie softens, suddenly feeling flattered that he's doing all of this out of love for her. He tells her he wants to go to Montreal and after that they can go to NYC if she wants to; if she doesn't like it, she can go back."
Sister Carrie,27,6,"Carrie's intrigued by the prospect of checking out some cool new cities, but she's still pretty mad and tells Hurstwood not to talk to her."
Sister Carrie,27,7,"Hurstwood pleads with her to stay with him. She's not sure. He tries to charm her by offering to get her a sleeping car, and when she declines he lets her rest her head on his balled up coat. What a guy. She admits to herself that he is thoughtful."
Sister Carrie,27,8,"Hurstwood again thinks about how taking the money was a colossal mistake. He wishes he could give it all back and be forgiven, and worries that the police have begun looking for him."
Sister Carrie,27,9,"Next stop: Detroit. Hurstwood and Carrie get off, and he tells her they should get another train for Montreal so he buys the tickets. Carrie realizes she doesn't have so much as a toothbrush with her and gets depressed, but Hurstwood assures her he'll buy her whatever she wants once they get to Canada."
Sister Carrie,27,10,"They get on the train, Montreal-bound."
Sister Carrie,26,0,"We pick up with Hurstwood, back from his walk. He receives Carrie's letter and, surprisingly, he doesn't feel that bad. He figures she's probably just playing hard to get."
Sister Carrie,26,1,"Hurstwood thinks about going to see Mrs. Hurstwood's lawyers, but then decides not to. He wonders how he's going to try to win Carrie back."
Sister Carrie,26,2,"He indulges in a little retail therapy, buying some linens and ties, and then goes to hang out at the Palmer House (a fancy hotel). And who do you think he happens to see there?"
Sister Carrie,26,3,Drouet.
Sister Carrie,26,4,"Hurstwood watches him heading up the stairs with a key, and asks the desk clerk if Drouet is staying there alone. The clerk tells him yes (so much for privacy), and this puts Hurstwood in a great mood: Drouet and Carrie must've had a fight."
Sister Carrie,26,5,"Hurstwood decides this is the perfect opportunity to go see Carrie at her apartment. He eats dinner, checks with the hotel clerk to make sure Drouet is still in his hotel room, and then takes a cab to see Carrie."
Sister Carrie,26,6,"When he arrives, the maid tells him that she's gone to Hooley's theater. He's about to go to the theater to find her, but then decides against it, figuring she might not be alone so the timing wouldn't be the best."
Sister Carrie,26,7,"So he returns to his office. A friend stops by to say hi. A few more of his friends stop in to chitchat, and before long, they bust out the booze. Hurstwood is eager to drown his sorrows, so he gladly partakes."
Sister Carrie,26,8,"By midnight (closing time for the hotel), everyone begins to clear out except Hurstwood who needs to close up shop. Hurstwood has got a pretty strong buzz going: ""He had arrived at that state where his mind, though clear, was, nevertheless, warm in its fancies"" (27.44)."
Sister Carrie,26,9,Hurstwood starts closing up. One of the things he does every night before he leaves is check to make sure that the safe has been locked by the cashier (the only other person besides the owners who knows its combination). When Hurstwood pulls on the door of the safe he discovers that it isn't locked. His first impulse is to just check to make sure the money hasn't been touched and then close the door.
Sister Carrie,26,10,But on second thought…
Sister Carrie,26,11,"There's a lot of money in there—like thousands of dollars. A ""voice in his ear"" tells Hurstwood to count it, so he does. Another voice asks Hurstwood why he doesn't just shut the safe already. Are you picturing a little angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other? We totally are."
Sister Carrie,26,12,"The devil voice answers back with ""Did you ever have ten thousand dollars in ready money?"" (27.57). Hurstwood thinks about how his wife is going to get all of his money in the divorce, but puts the money back. He is about to close the safe, but hesitates. He goes to the windows and pulls the curtains down, then double checks the doors to make sure they're locked. Looks like the devil might win this one."
Sister Carrie,26,13,"He goes to his office nearby to think (the safe is still open). Unsurprisingly, he thinks about how the money could solve all his problems. He returns to the safe and takes the money out, but then puts it back in and almost closes the door."
Sister Carrie,26,14,"We're reminded that Hurstwood is still kind of drunk. He goes back to his office, then to the safe again to look at the money—the suspense is killing us."
Sister Carrie,26,15,"He goes and gets his ""hand satchel,"" returns again to the safe, takes out the money and receipts, and again almost closes the safe. His mind is reeling as he's thinking about whether he should really do this or not. He puts all the money in the bag."
Sister Carrie,26,16,"But then he's stricken by the feeling that he just can't do it, as the thought of all the trouble he could get into with the law suddenly occurs to him."
Sister Carrie,26,17,"Hurstwood puts the money back into the drawers, but realizes he's arranged it in the drawers wrong. While he takes the money out to fix the problem, it crosses his mind again to take the money. While he's busy thinking it over, the safe clicks shut."
Sister Carrie,26,18,"Yup, definitely locked, he realizes as he desperately tries to open the safe. Uh-oh—he's in deep trouble now."
Sister Carrie,26,19,"Hurstwood goes into his office with the money, gets his coat and satchel, locks his desk and leaves the hotel. He goes into a drugstore and asks to use that fancy new invention called the phone booth (it's really a shame these things are becoming extinct—just look at how much fun people had in them back in the day). Hurstwood calls the train station to find out when the next train to Detroit is. Ultimately, he plans to go to Montreal, Canada."
Sister Carrie,26,20,Suddenly Carrie pops into his head—he can't leave the country without her.
Sister Carrie,26,21,"Hurstwood jumps into a horse-drawn cab and takes it to Carrie's place. He bursts in and tells her that Drouet is injured, and that Carrie needs to come with Hurstwood to the hospital right now. Carrie throws some clothes on and jumps into the cab with Hurstwood… who tells the cabby to take them to the train station."
Sister Carrie,1,0,Carrie arrives at her sister's one-floor apartment (and we now learn that sis is named Minnie).
Sister Carrie,1,1,"Pretty much the only thing Carrie likes about the place is the sound of the bells on the horse-cars outside, and the apartment itself is pretty drab with shoddy furniture and threadbare carpet."
Sister Carrie,1,2,"Minnie promptly puts Carrie to work, plopping down her baby into Carrie's arms as Minnie gets dinner together. No slacking in this house, it seems."
Sister Carrie,1,3,"We meet Minnie's husband, Mr. Hanson, who seems less than thrilled to have his sister-in-law crashing at his apartment. He drops a hint that she'd better start looking for work. Stat."
Sister Carrie,1,4,"Carrie takes a better look around and gets more depressed by the meagerness of the apartment. She's also trying to keep the baby amused, but she's no Mary Poppins; the kid starts crying and Mr. Hanson has to rescue it (and yes, the baby is referred to as it—poor kid has neither gender nor name)."
Sister Carrie,1,5,"The meal gets underway, and Carrie talks about her plans to start her job search the next day. Mr. Hanson is eager to help in this department and tells her exactly where she should look: the big manufacturing houses along Franklin Street where ""lots of girls work."""
Sister Carrie,1,6,They chat a bit more about the neighborhood until Mr. Hanson abruptly jumps up and announces he's got to get up early so he's going to hit the sack.
Sister Carrie,1,7,"Time for some girl talk… Well, not exactly. Carrie asks what time Minnie gets up for breakfast and Minnie replies that she gets up at the crack of dawn: 4:40AM. They finish washing dishes."
Sister Carrie,1,8,"Carrie concludes that starting something up with Drouet is probably not the best idea, given the conservative vibe around the Hanson household, so she dashes off to get some paper and ink from Minnie. She writes to Drouet telling him not to stop by, using the pretty lame excuse that her sister's place is too small."
Sister Carrie,1,9,"Should she say anything more, like what a cool dude she thinks he is? Nah, she decides, short and sweet is better, though she does, of course, obsess over whether to sign it very truly or sincerely. Then she seals and addresses it."
Sister Carrie,1,10,"Carrie moves to the alcove in the front room where she'll be staying. She rocks on a rocking chair in front of the window, looking out onto the street until she gets tired and tumbles into bed."
Sister Carrie,1,11,"By the time Carrie rolls out of bed at 8:00AM, Mr. Hanson is long gone (he gets up almost as insanely early as his wife to get to his job at the stock-yards)."
Sister Carrie,1,12,"We learn a bit more about Minnie and the changes she's undergone since Carrie had last seen her. The ""thin, rugged, rapidly aging"" woman (at the ripe old age of twenty-seven) is clearly in need of a makeover in Carrie's view, and Minnie shares her husband's sentiment that Carrie had better get off her butt and find a job. She's optimistic that Carrie could fill the illustrious position of shop girl."
Sister Carrie,1,13,"The narrator assures us that we'll be getting a front row seat to Carrie's job search in just a moment, but first the narrator assumes that we need a quick lesson on the Chicago commercial scene, so we're treated to a few paragraphs of that. It turns out that in 1889, during the Gilded Age, the city was growing so fast that there were lots of business opportunities in Chicago, which drew tons of men and women looking to make some dough (this part kind of feels like a history book, but hang in because it helps set the scene)."
Sister Carrie,1,14,"And, as promised, here's where we meet up with Carrie again, as she's walking through the ""vast wholesale and shopping district"" of Chicago. She's a little intimidated by all these huge buildings, and she's also pretty freaked out by the prospect of actually going into one of them and asking for a job."
Sister Carrie,0,0,"Carrie Meeber is on a train bound for her sister's place in Chicago. She's eighteen and it's her first time ever leaving her small town, so she's kind of nervous, but also pretty psyched. Our trusty narrator provides us with a description of Carrie, right down to her tiny feet."
Sister Carrie,0,1,"Carrie's riding along when suddenly the dude sitting behind her strikes up a conversation. She's a bit hesitant to respond at first because of her ""maidenly reserve,"" but she's feeling daring what with being away from home and all, so she starts chatting."
Sister Carrie,0,2,"He can tell this is probably her first trip to the city even though she tries to pretend like she's some big world traveler. We learn that this guy (whose name is Drouet, by the way) is a drummer. No, not like Animal from the Muppets—in a nineteenth-century kind of way, when drummer meant traveling salesman."
Sister Carrie,0,3,"Drouet is one very well-dressed guy. In fact, Carrie feels a bit self-conscious about her own simple clothes after checking out his fancy threads. Drouet's not tripping about her garb, though, and tells Carrie about the places she needs to check out, like Lincoln Park and Michigan Boulevard; it's pretty clear that he is totally hitting on her."
Sister Carrie,0,4,"And she seems to be into him, too. Or maybe she just likes the attention? He tells her she reminds him of a famous actress."
Sister Carrie,0,5,"As the train draws closer to the station, Drouet offers to show Carrie around while he's there in Chicago on business, but she's not sure and thinks her sister might not be too pleased with the idea of her going off with some random guy. Drouet dismisses her concern and manages to get Carrie to give him the address of her sister's place."
Sister Carrie,0,6,"Next stop: Chicago. As the train pulls in to the city, Carrie takes it all in. It's kind of a big deal because, remember, this is her first time ever in the big city."
Sister Carrie,0,7,"The train stops and they get off. Drouet tries to carry her suitcase, but Carrie wants to get rid of him pronto before sis shows up, so she pretty much tells him to get lost. He obliges, but tells her he's just going to hang around the station for a while in case her sister doesn't show; this pleases Carrie."
Sister Carrie,0,8,"Carrie's sister arrives and spots her on the platform. They hug in a kind of perfunctory way, and right off the bat, we're alerted to ""a change of affectional atmosphere."" It turns out that Carrie's sister is a bit of a Debbie Downer—we're told, ""Her sister carried with her most of the grimness of shift and toil."" Good times."
Sister Carrie,0,9,"Carrie's sis asks all the usual questions: how're Mom and Dad, etc. Carrie answers distractedly, since she's looking for Drouet who indeed kept his promise to hang around to see that she met up with sister safely."
Sister Carrie,0,10,The two exchange secret smiles.
Sister Carrie,19,0,Hurstwood goes home and ponders the problem of getting Carrie away from Drouet.
Sister Carrie,19,1,"The next morning at breakfast, Hurstwood and his wife argue heatedly over when they're going to go on vacation. He doesn't want to go as soon as she does, so she's like cool—the kids and I will go without you. Hurstwood's not happy about that."
Sister Carrie,19,2,"Mrs. H hasn't had much luck landing Jessica a husband at the races, so she wants to go on vacation in search of better matrimonial prospects."
Sister Carrie,19,3,Hurstwood goes off to meet Carrie.
Sister Carrie,19,4,"Back at Carrie's and Drouet's apartment, Drouet tells Carrie that he's ready to get hitched. She says she doesn't believe him."
Sister Carrie,19,5,"Drouet leaves and then Carrie leaves to meet Hurstwood. Drouet returns to the apartment to get some bills he forgot and asks the maid if Carrie went out. She says yes, and they strike up a conversation (remember that this is the maid who's hot for Drouet). They both get flirty."
Sister Carrie,19,6,"Then the maid spills the beans. She tells Drouet just how often Hurstwood stopped by to see Carrie when he was out of town: like, every day."
Sister Carrie,19,7,Drouet is suddenly not in the mood to flirt with the maid.
Sister Carrie,19,8,The maid is called away and Drouet finally seems to have caught on to what Hurstwood and Carrie have been up to.
Sister Carrie,19,9,"Drouet gets ready to leave, and on his way out he runs into the maid again. He seizes the opportunity to grill her a little more about Carrie and Hurstwood—she gladly obliges—and Drouet resolves to confront Carrie."
Sister Carrie,19,10,Yikes.
Sister Carrie,18,0,It's show time.
Sister Carrie,18,1,"Drouet and Hurstwood sit together in the audience. The curtain rises, but Carrie isn't in the opening scene, so Drouet and Hurstwood whisper (even worse than texting, guys). It becomes clear pretty quickly that this isn't exactly Broadway—the players manage to remember their lines, but that's about it."
Sister Carrie,18,2,"And then Carrie enters… and she totally bombs. It's painful—no, make that excruciating—to watch. It's so bad, in fact, that Drouet dashes backstage to catch her between scenes and give her a little pep talk."
Sister Carrie,18,3,"The pep talk helps. Carrie gets better (with ""better"" meaning ""the audience was at least not irritated""). Drouet remains backstage and continues to coach her in between scenes."
Sister Carrie,18,4,"And as the play goes on, Carrie gets really good. Like, Oscar-worthy good. Hurstwood and Drouet are both amazed by her sudden star power."
Sister Carrie,18,5,"Hurstwood comes backstage at intermission to congratulate Carrie, and when he sees Drouet and Carrie together, he becomes crazy jealous. Carrie and Hurstwood suppress their burning desire for one another and pretend to just be pals. A bitter Hurstwood returns to his seat."
Sister Carrie,18,6,"The play resumes and Carrie continues to deliver an awesome performance. Hurstwood and Drouet are both falling in love with her all over again, and Drouet even resolves to marry her now. Uh-oh…"
Sister Carrie,18,7,"Here's the gist of the play: Laura (Carrie's character) left the man she loved because she thought he deserved a woman of his high social standing. He marries the rich woman, even though he's still in love with Laura. Sounds kind of familiar, right? Hurstwood certainly thinks so, and is even more deeply moved by Carrie's performance given how the play's situation resonates with his own."
Sister Carrie,18,8,"The play ends and the audience applauds wildly. Someone brings flowers to Carrie—they're from Hurstwood, who thinks that he has to get Carrie away from Drouet. Backstage, Carrie basks in the glory of her success."
Sister Carrie,18,9,"Hurstwood, Carrie and Drouet climb into a carriage and head to dinner. Afterward, as Drouet and Carrie say their goodnights to Hurstwood, Hurstwood whispers to Carrie to meet him the following day. Hurstwood, who is now filled with ""hate"" for Drouet, is determined to do something. Pronto."
Sister Carrie,13,0,"Carrie returns from her rendezvous with Hurstwood just as Mrs. Hale takes a peek out her window. A-ha—Drouet had better keep an eye on her, she thinks… and she's not the only one with suspicions. The maid who let Hurstwood in has figured out what's going on (which, incidentally, pleases her to no end since she's got a little thing for Drouet)."
Sister Carrie,13,1,"Carrie is so enamored of Hurstwood that she's now barely giving a second thought to Drouet. Hurstwood is similarly on Cloud Nine, hoping he can have his cake and eat it too, as he keeps up both his romance with Carrie and his home life."
Sister Carrie,13,2,Carrie and Hurstwood have a dinner date. Things don't get hot and heavy because Carrie is still pretending to be married to Drouet and Hurstwood is pretending to believe that she's married to Drouet.
Sister Carrie,13,3,"Hurstwood asks her to go to the fair with him the following Tuesday but she declines, telling him it's too soon. However, they agree that they'll write to each other (as in letters—remember those?)."
Sister Carrie,13,4,Drouet returns from his business trip and drops in to see Hurstwood at his office. They chitchat and Hurstwood mentions that he checked in on Carrie while Drouet was away. Hurstwood invites them both to go to a show.
Sister Carrie,13,5,"Drouet returns to the apartment and kisses Carrie, who doesn't quite kiss back. So cold."
Sister Carrie,13,6,Drouet boasts about what a great job he did on his trip and how successful he's been as a salesman the past quarter and how he thinks he'll get a raise soon… and then they can get married.
Sister Carrie,13,7,"Yeah, right, like that's ever going to happen, she tells him. He tries to reassure her, but it doesn't work. She doesn't think he's serious about marrying her, and Hurstwood, in contrast, seems to be dying to get her to the altar, she thinks."
Sister Carrie,13,8,"Drouet mentions that he saw Hurstwood and that he's invited them to go to the theater. He also remarks that Hurstwood said that he'd stopped by while he was gone. Carrie almost blows her cover when she says that yes, he came by Sunday. Drouet says that's funny because he'd told him that he called a week ago. Oops."
Sister Carrie,13,9,"Carrie nervously answers yes to Drouet's next question: ""so he called twice?"" But the naïve Drouet shrugs it off, figuring that he'd misunderstood Hurstwood."
Sister Carrie,13,10,Carrie soon gets a letter from Hurstwood who tells her they need to get their story straight about how many times they actually hung out while Drouet was away. He suggests they meet up before the theater outing with Drouet.
Sister Carrie,13,11,"She writes back that Drouet doesn't seem suspicious, but that she feels guilty. When they meet, Hurstwood tries to allay her conscience by telling her that as soon as Drouet's gone, he'll fix everything. She takes this to mean that he's about to pop the question, of course."
Sister Carrie,13,12,Hurstwood and Carrie agree not to act flirtatious in front of Drouet anymore.
Sister Carrie,13,13,"The curtain rises at the theater and Drouet, Hurstwood, and Carrie watch ""The Covenant"" (which is not a real play; this one was made up by Dreiser). And what a coincidence: there's a scene in the play in which a woman is having an affair."
Sister Carrie,13,14,"After the play, Drouet remarks that he has no pity for the ""chump"" husband, who deserved to be cheated on for not being attentive enough to his wife. Isn't it ironic? Don't you think?"
Sister Carrie,13,15,"On their way out of the theater, a homeless man approaches the trio and asks for change. Drouet doesn't hesitate to give him a dime, but Hurstwood and Carrie are so busy making googly eyes at each other that they pay no attention to the man."
Sister Carrie,12,0,"Hurstwood can't stop thinking about Carrie. This girl is way too good for Drouet, in his opinion, and he wants to see her again as soon as possible."
Sister Carrie,12,1,But Carrie feels conflicted: she's crazy about Hurstwood but she does feel some loyalty to Drouet.
Sister Carrie,12,2,"We learn that because Hurstwood has been such a model employee in the past, he feels entitled to take a few hours for himself here and there during the workday, so he heads off to see Carrie at her apartment. Carrie's on her way out to take a walk, when the maid lets her know that Hurstwood has just shown up."
Sister Carrie,12,3,"They go for a walk together along Washington Boulevard, a ritzy part of town. Hurstwood is nervous that he'll see someone he knows so he ducks into a livery stable to get a horse so they can go for a ride and be less conspicuous."
Sister Carrie,12,4,"Hurstwood lets Carrie take the reins. Nervous tension. Finally he spills his feelings, telling her how happy he's been since they've started hanging out. Inwardly she's thrilled, but tries to play it cool."
Sister Carrie,12,5,And then he drops the L-word. That's right—he's madly in love with her.
Sister Carrie,12,6,"But she doesn't say much in return. Ouch. So he goes on talking, telling her about what a sad life he has surrounded by people he can't stand and how if he just had her everything would be okay. She relates to his sense of loneliness."
Sister Carrie,12,7,"He seems to be throwing himself a pity party to appeal to her sympathy, which seems pretty pathetic… except that it works. This time, when he makes a move by putting his arm around her, she doesn't back away."
Sister Carrie,12,8,"He tells her to say that she loves him. The cat's still got her tongue, but when he boldly goes in for the kiss: ""her lips replied."""
Sister Carrie,20,0,"Hurstwood and Carrie meet again in secret. They chat about how great her performance in the play was, then things turn serious and he begs her to go away with him."
Sister Carrie,20,1,"Carrie's not sure. She's still wondering whether Hurstwood knows that she and Drouet aren't really married, and she wonders if Hurstwood wants to marry her."
Sister Carrie,20,2,"He continues to beg, pleading with her to come with him tonight or Saturday at the latest. She asks if they can get married Saturday and he says yes, so she agrees."
Sister Carrie,20,3,They're both thrilled—never mind the minor issue of Carrie's live-in lover or the fact that old Hurstwood is already married. They're in love.
Sister Carrie,20,4,They agree to meet the next day to further discuss their plans.
Sister Carrie,21,0,Mrs. Hurstwood is suspicious about her husband's newfound zest for life and the fact that he's not kowtowing to her desires as much as he had in the past.
Sister Carrie,21,1,Mrs. H scolds Jessica for being late for breakfast (Hurstwood himself has already left the house at this point) and for her general brattiness.
Sister Carrie,21,2,"We jump back a bit and learn that a few days after Hurstwood and Carrie took that ride on the horse (the one where Hurstwood declared his love for Carrie), Hurstwood's neighbor Dr. Beale saw them. At the time, Dr. Beale mistook Carrie for Mrs. Hurstwood, so when he ran into Mrs. H later on, he mentioned that he saw her out riding with Mr. H. Now in light of Hurstwood's great mood, she's even more suspicious of that incident."
Sister Carrie,21,3,"We catch up a little more with Mrs. Hurstwood and her suspicions. It seems the day after Carrie's theater debut, Mrs. H and Jessica went to the races where they ran into some acquaintances who'd been to the theater the previous evening… and they were so sorry to hear that poor Mrs. Hurstwood was too sick to accompany her husband. Oops."
Sister Carrie,21,4,"With all of these suspicions swirling in her head, Mrs. Hurstwood is now on the warpath as we return to the present scene in which she's waiting for Hurstwood to get home."
Sister Carrie,21,5,"Hurstwood arrives home in a fantastic mood, as he's still aglow from his meeting with Carrie."
Sister Carrie,21,6,"His great mood really irks Mrs. H—he's so happy that he even tries to engage her in some pleasant conversation. She's not having it though, giving him curt little answers to every question he asks."
Sister Carrie,21,7,"Hurstwood can tell something's up, but figures she's mad about the vacation stuff, so he tells her they can go early if she wants."
Sister Carrie,21,8,"And then she drops the bomb that she suspects he's having an affair. He says he has no idea what she's talking about, and she tells him she wants the money for the vacation by the next morning."
Sister Carrie,21,9,"The fight gets nastier, as Mrs. H rattles off all the evidence she has of his affair. He still denies it, so she tells him again that she wants the money. He says she won't get it, and she says she's getting a lawyer."
Sister Carrie,21,10,He tells her to do whatever she wants and he leaves.
Sister Carrie,6,0,"Carrie is totally stoked about the money Drouet gave her. She feels a flicker of shame for being ""weak enough"" to accept it, but she rationalizes that she really needs it, so it's all good. Plus, Drouet is even more awesome than she'd originally thought for aiding a damsel in financial distress, she thinks."
Sister Carrie,6,1,"Carrie gets home, looking like the cat who ate the canary, and concerned about how to buy new clothes without Minnie getting suspicious of where exactly she got the money to pay for them."
Sister Carrie,6,2,"When Minnie asks about the job search, Carrie fibs and says that she has ""the promise of something"" at a department store."
Sister Carrie,6,3,This doesn't ease Minnie's mind and she hints to Carrie that maybe she'd better consider hightailing it home to Mom and Dad if the job doesn't pan out. The idea of doing that makes Carrie want to barf and she's even more grateful for Drouet's money.
Sister Carrie,6,4,She sits in the front room and mulls over the more immediate dilemma of how she's going to buy a jacket without provoking a million questions from Minnie. All this fretting puts her in a really bad mood.
Sister Carrie,6,5,"While she's eating dinner, Carrie decides the only thing to do is to return the money to Drouet, so she resolves to do just that the next day, after she looks for work (check out Miss Responsible). But it's all very depressing and the only thing that helps ease the pain is holding the dollar bills in her hand."
Sister Carrie,6,6,"She goes downtown to look for jobs in the morning, but she just can't seem to bring herself to apply for anything. While she's there, she may as well do a little browsing in the department store, right?"
Sister Carrie,6,7,"Bad idea. The girl is totally torturing herself, looking at all this stuff she wants but knows she shouldn't buy."
Sister Carrie,6,8,"Miraculously, she leaves the store without touching the twenty bucks in her pocket and goes to meet up with Drouet. He's surprised to see that she's not decked out in a new jacket and shoes—she tells him she can't take the money, which he responds to by taking her to lunch at another fancy restaurant."
Sister Carrie,6,9,"Over lunch, she explains that she can't take the money because her sister would start asking questions; she mentions she might have to go back to her parents' house. But Drouet's got a way better idea: he'll pay for her to rent a room. Plus, he'll take her on that shopping trip she deserves. (Did someone say sugar daddy?)"
Sister Carrie,6,10,"It's not a complete free ride he's offering, though; they both agree that it's best if she still tries to find a job. And so with just a little reservation on Carrie's part, off they go shopping and then apartment hunting."
Sister Carrie,6,11,"Carrie returns to Minnie's place, and after another dinner during which Minnie and husband make it clear that an unemployed Carrie isn't going to be welcome in their home much longer, Carrie writes a note bidding them adieu. She tells Minnie she's off to hang out in her favorite spot downstairs, but we know where she's really going: to meet Drouet on the corner."
Sister Carrie,7,0,"Minnie and Mr. Hanson awake to find Carrie's note. They're a little shocked, but neither rushes to call out the search party."
Sister Carrie,7,1,"Carrie wakes up in her new place, a bit worried about what's going to happen to her now, but then Drouet comes over and invites her to breakfast and more shopping. Afterward, he takes her to see ""The Mikado,"" an operetta. On the way there, Carrie spots one of the girls she'd worked with at the factory. This freaks her out so much that she bumps into a stranger."
Sister Carrie,7,2,"Carrie is all about the theater, and afterward she and Drouet stop for a bite to eat. More sparks fly between them, and love is in the air as they walk arm-in-arm back to Carrie's apartment."
Sister Carrie,7,3,"Jump to Minnie: She's having a nightmare about Carrie being swallowed up into a coalmine, and starts talking in her sleep, waking Sven."
Sister Carrie,7,4,Fast forward a week. Drouet drops by his pal Hurstwood's office to invite him over to his house for a friendly game of euchre (a card game). Hurstwood agrees and promises to bring the booze.
Sister Carrie,14,0,"We learn that Hurstwood's been so wrapped up in his affair with Carrie that he's pretty much been ignoring everything going on at home. Every morning he goes through the motions of having breakfast with Mrs. Hurstwood and the kids, but mostly buries his nose in the newspaper so he doesn't have to actually talk to any of them."
Sister Carrie,14,1,"We jump back to a scene in the Hurstwood home that took place on the night of Hurstwood's latest theater outing with Drouet and Carrie (the one where they went to see that fake play ""The Covenant""). Right before he leaves for the play, Mrs. Hurstwood tells him that she wants him to get them all season tickets to the horse races. She's never asked for season tickets before, but her rich friends are getting them and she wants to ""exhibit"" Jessica in the hopes of attracting a rich husband for her."
Sister Carrie,14,2,"Hurstwood tells her they're not easy to get and they're insanely expensive, but she throws a tantrum and he gives in. He doesn't stick around for supper."
Sister Carrie,14,3,We return to the present as Hurstwood eats breakfast with his family. He's irritated because Jessica keeps dropping hints that she wants to go to Europe for the summer like her rich friends. He's further ticked that George Jr. went off to another town for a tennis match and didn't tell him. He feels out of the loop with his kids.
Sister Carrie,14,4,"Hurstwood cheers himself up by thinking of Carrie. He contemplates the fact that Carrie has no clue that he's married and he's hopeful that she won't find out. They've become serious pen pals, writing to each other ever since the theater night. Hurstwood writes her a letter asking her to meet him in the park."
Sister Carrie,14,5,"They meet up, and after exchanging a few pleasantries, Hurstwood cuts to the chase: he wants her to leave Drouet and come away with him."
Sister Carrie,14,6,"She asks him where they'd go, and he asks her where she wants to go. She doesn't want to stay in Chicago because Drouet's there, but Hurstwood would have to give up his job if they left, so he tries to convince her Chicago is big enough for all of them."
Sister Carrie,14,7,"And then she drops a bomb: ""I shouldn't want to get married as long as [Drouet]'s here"" (15.80), she tells him. Hurstwood panics at first, as the word bigamy flashes in his mind like a neon sign, but he can't help feeling happy that she feels so strongly about him."
Sister Carrie,14,8,Hurstwood gets a brilliant idea: he'll give Carrie a little test. He asks her what she would do if he came to her and told her that he had to go away and wasn't coming back. Would she go with him?
Sister Carrie,14,9,"Duh—the answer is yes. He presses, asking if she would still go if they couldn't get married right away. She says that would be okay as long as they got married ""as soon as we got to the other end of the journey."" He plays it off like he's joking, telling her he'll come get her some evening, and she reinforces her sentiment that she will only stay with him if he marries her."
Sister Carrie,14,10,They happily stroll through the park together.
Sister Carrie,15,0,"Drouet is a member of the Freemasons, which is an actual secret society. We could've picked up on this way back in Chapter One by the narrator's description of his ring, but now it's made explicitly clear."
Sister Carrie,15,1,"Drouet goes to a meeting at the lodge and one of his fellow masons (a.k.a. Elks), Mr. Quincel, tells him that the organization wants to raise money to buy new furniture for the lodge, so they're going to put on a play. Quincel wants Drouet's help in finding an actress who could take one of the parts. Drouet agrees to help though he doesn't actually know anyone who could do it."
Sister Carrie,15,2,"The whole thing isn't high on Drouet's list of priorities, and a few days later he finds himself in a bind when he receives a letter informing him that the first play rehearsal is Friday night. They need the name and address of that actress he promised them pronto… oops."
Sister Carrie,15,3,"Desperate to find someone, Drouet asks Carrie if she'll take the role. She's flattered to death, but not sure—she has no acting experience. But Carrie has secretly wanted to be an actress after having gone to the theater, so it doesn't take much arm-twisting for Drouet to convince her to take the part."
Sister Carrie,15,4,Drouet leaves and Carrie sits in the rocking chair and fantasizes about being on stage.
Sister Carrie,15,5,"Drouet drops into the lodge to let Quincel know that Carrie will be taking the part (of Laura). He also decides that Carrie needs a jazzier stage name, so he christens her Carrie Madenda. Quincel gives him the script and he takes it home to Carrie."
Sister Carrie,15,6,"She reads through it and finds out that the part is pretty small and requires ""suffering and tears."" She spends the next day memorizing her lines. When she performs a scene for Drouet, he's super impressed."
Sister Carrie,37,0,"Carrie has no luck in meeting with either Mr. Gray or Mr. Daly, two managers who will meet only by appointment. She tries a few more theaters, but gets discouraged and goes home."
Sister Carrie,37,1,"A few days later, she manages to meet with the manager of the Casino, a theater on Broadway, who tells her to come back the following week when he might have something for her. That seems a long time away and rent will be due soon so she badgers Hurstwood about looking for a job. Hurstwood sets off to try to get a job as a bartender (that job he couldn't bear to take before, remember?), but gives up the search pretty quickly and goes back home."
Sister Carrie,37,2,"The next week, Carrie goes back to see the manager of the Casino. He checks her out and tells her to come the next morning. Something in his voice sounds promising to her and she's thrilled at the thought that she's finally gotten somewhere. Carrie tells Hurstwood she's gotten a place in the chorus (way to count chickens before they hatch). They're both excited that she'll be bringing in twelve or fourteen bucks a week, by Carrie's estimates, so they have a nice steak dinner to celebrate. Hurstwood even shaves."
Sister Carrie,37,3,"Carrie goes to the theater the next morning and ""was given a place in the line."" Okay, so the counting chickens thing actually worked out this time. The manager asks her name and she tells him Carrie Madenda, the name Drouet gave her way back when."
Sister Carrie,37,4,"The manager pairs Carrie with another chorus girl and the rehearsal begins. It's much different, Carrie finds, than the rehearsals of her previous experience back in Chicago. The manager is tougher than an army sergeant and he insults Carrie's dancing, though she doesn't seem to mind since she's so excited to be there."
Sister Carrie,37,5,"Carrie goes home and Hurstwood isn't there. She practices her dance moves until he gets back. She's a little irked that she has to stop practicing to make dinner, and she decides that she's not going to do that for long—he can order take-out from now on."
Sister Carrie,37,6,"As rehearsals go on, Carrie realizes that being a chorus girl isn't all it's cracked up to be, and she feels like a total nobody in comparison to the stars of the show. Things aren't great on the home front either, as Carrie is really beginning to resent the way that Hurstwood is sponging off her."
Sister Carrie,37,7,Hurstwood tells her that they need to save the money she's earning because his savings is really dwindling. But she has other plans… like a shopping spree.
Sister Carrie,37,8,"Carrie's NYC debut rolls around, but it's not incredibly exciting for her since none of the advertisements seem to highlight her role in the chorus. Hurstwood doesn't even go to see her because they figure it'd be a waste of money since her part is so tiny."
Sister Carrie,37,9,"During the show, Carrie observes that she could probably perform just as well as some of the big stars."
Sister Carrie,37,10,"At home, Carrie asks Hurstwood about that job he has lined up. He says that he thinks it will still work out, but not for another month; he asks if she'd mind supporting them until then. She's annoyed, but agrees to help him out, and he promises he'll try to get some work."
Sister Carrie,37,11,And then he goes back to reading the paper.
Sister Carrie,36,0,"Hurstwood reveals to Carrie that he has a hundred bucks to his name. When he hints that his job prospects are really dim, she suggests that she might be able to find work as an actress. Hurstwood doesn't like this idea because he's afraid that she'll become successful and leave him, so he insults her by telling her she's not good enough to make it as an actress in New York."
Sister Carrie,36,1,She secretly resolves to try and become an actress.
Sister Carrie,36,2,"After a short time, Hurstwood, realizing that starving to death doesn't sound like much fun, changes his tune and gets on board with the idea of Carrie getting work as an actress. He also has a bit of good news himself: he's got a job lined up at a hotel in the fall. They've just got to get through the summer (on fifty bucks)."
Sister Carrie,36,3,"Carrie sets off for Broadway… well, she sets off to try and find any part she possibly can on Broadway. She first gets a newspaper to find a theatrical agent, though, and takes it back to the apartment to comb through it. As she's reading, Hurstwood's interference gets on her nerves at first, but then he helps her pick out three agents to contact."
Sister Carrie,36,4,"She leaves to find the agents. Hurstwood, feeling a bit ashamed as Carrie goes off to try to become breadwinner, takes a walk."
Sister Carrie,36,5,"Carrie goes to Mrs. Bermudez's office first. The place is kind of creepy and Mrs. B isn't impressed with Carrie's short acting resume, but she takes down her address in case something opens up. Carrie's encounter with Mr. Jenks, the next agent on the list, pretty much goes down the same way, though he's a tad more helpful and suggests that she try to get some experience by getting a part in some small local production."
Sister Carrie,36,6,"The third agent she approaches tells her she'll need to pay fifty bucks before he can help her get a part, which is super shady. Carrie's so desperate though, that she actually considers pawning some of her stuff to get the money. Carrie returns home and Hurstwood talks her out of giving the dude any money. She tells him her next move is to try and find a manager."
Sister Carrie,36,7,Hurstwood numbly rocks in his chair.
Sister Carrie,40,0,Hurstwood is sent into a barn with a group of other men to be trained to drive the motorcars.
Sister Carrie,40,1,"The barn is not a happy place, and the men there look even sadder and more desperate than Hurstwood. Hurstwood listens to them talk about the violence of the strike, despite the police presence. Most of the men sympathize with the striking workers, but they've been so beaten down by the economy that they feel they have no choice but to take the scabby work."
Sister Carrie,40,2,"It's Hurstwood's turn to learn to drive the car, and with no experience, he's pretty much like a sixteen-year old taking his first driving lesson (at least he doesn't have to parallel park). Driving turns out to be a lot tougher than he'd thought it was going to be (silly guy should've gone to our website)."
Sister Carrie,40,3,"After a quick and dreary lunch, it's back to training, and then at the end of the day, Hurstwood decides it would be easier to try to spend the night nearby instead of going home. He finds out from another guy that the company has set up some cots for the scabs to sleep on, so Hurstwood grabs a quick bite to eat in a cheap restaurant nearby and heads for his cot. The place is freezing and pretty dismal. He goes to sleep and dreams that he's back in Chicago in his old fancy house (someone's in for a rude awakening… literally)."
Sister Carrie,40,4,"He gets up feeling pretty awful, and splashes water from a horse trough on his face. He scores a meal ticket for breakfast from the foreman and then starts training again."
Sister Carrie,40,5,"It's the fourth day of the strike and the strikers are getting angrier and more violent, especially because of all the scabs who are allowing the company to still function. Hurstwood doesn't know things have gotten worse though, since he's been busy training in the barn."
Sister Carrie,40,6,"But now it's time for him to hit the road. He takes his trolley car out on the street, accompanied by two policemen as promised. Not only does Hurstwood have to worry about operating the car, he has to deal with strikers yelling at him and crowding around the car (check this out to see what it would've been like to be in a NYC trolley car at this time—well, minus the angry strikers, of course)."
Sister Carrie,40,7,"It gets so bad that the police officer orders Hurstwood to stop the car. The officers confront the strikers, shoving them and threatening to hit them with their clubs. The strikers don't back off so a police officer clubs one of them, and then someone else slugs that policeman and he and his partner start whacking everyone in sight with their clubs. Fortunately, no one is seriously injured."
Sister Carrie,40,8,"The strikers have put stones on the trolley track to block it from moving, and the police officer orders Hurstwood and the conductor to remove them. As they do, the strikers taunt Hurstwood for being a scab. They successfully clear the track and Hurstwood and the officers get back into the trolley car, but now the crowd is throwing rocks and stones through the window. He manages to drive away and escape. Whew—that was close."
Sister Carrie,40,9,"Hurstwood gives himself props for getting through the hairy situation, and returns to the station to recoup before going out again."
Sister Carrie,40,10,"This time, he's a little more confident and doesn't run into as much trouble, but it's pretty cold. He concludes that, ""This was a dog's life"" (41.169); to top it off, some kid throws a clod of mud at his arm. Ouch."
Sister Carrie,40,11,"On another trip later that day, a crowd blocks the tracks with a telegraph pole. The policemen get out to confront the crowd, telling Hurstwood to stay in the car. While he's sitting there, some men force their way into the car and attack him. The policemen get back in the car and Hurstwood takes off."
Sister Carrie,40,12,"But the trouble's not over yet—they run into another crowd and a bunch of women (yes, women) drag Hurstwood out of the crowd and beat him up. Two men rescue him and take him into a store, where he realizes he's bleeding. He watches what's going on outside: a patrol wagon and ambulance have just pulled up; the police arrest people. A police officer comes into the store and tells him to go out and take the car back, so Hurstwood heads to the car."
Sister Carrie,40,13,"Bang—a shot is fired and a bullet grazes Hurstwood's shoulder. He's totally freaked out. Okay, this is it—he's finally hit his limit and flees down a side street."
Sister Carrie,40,14,"Ah, when it rains it… snows. A terrible snowstorm hits as Hurstwood is walking to catch the ferry."
Sister Carrie,40,15,"When he finally returns to the apartment, he's never been so happy to climb into his rocking chair."
Sister Carrie,41,0,"Hurstwood doesn't provide Carrie with the gory details of his involvement in the strike, and she assumes he quit the job out of laziness. While Hurstwood's been working, Carrie has managed to work her way up, and now has an entire line to say in the play she's acting in."
Sister Carrie,41,1,"At home, Hurstwood goes back to rocking, reading the paper, and daydreaming about his old life."
Sister Carrie,41,2,"Lola asks Carrie if she wants to move in together so they can both save money on rent (remember, she's still assuming Carrie's a single gal since she never says a word about Hurstwood), but Carrie tells her she isn't sure. Then Carrie gets an even better role in the play, which comes with a much bigger salary, so she decides to take Lola up on the offer to become roomies."
Sister Carrie,41,3,"At the same time, Hurstwood suggests to Carrie that they should move to an even smaller place to save money. She can't even bear the thought though, and tells Lola that she's definitely up for moving in together. The two of them find a place."
Sister Carrie,41,4,"With the move now only two days away, Carrie still hasn't told Hurstwood. She starts feeling a little sorry for him, so she gives him some money and asks him to go get food so she can cook them a nice dinner. When he comes back, the guilt-ridden Carrie tells him to keep the change. He thinks this is a little weird and starts to wonder if something's up."
Sister Carrie,41,5,"Carrie goes to Lola's apartment and finds her packing; she asks to borrow twenty-five dollars that Lola had promised to lend her. Meanwhile, Hurstwood ventures out for a walk."
Sister Carrie,41,6,Warning: you may need some Kleenex for the next scene.
Sister Carrie,41,7,"Hurstwood gets back a few hours later to an empty apartment and notices an envelope near his chair. Uh-oh. He opens it and finds twenty bucks and a note from Carrie. She's not coming back, but he should feel free to sell her furniture, she writes. Hurstwood sees that she's taken her clothes and belongings, and the whole place seems incredibly empty and lonely now. Sniff."
Sister Carrie,41,8,"Hurstwood sits down in the rocker, but he can't even rock."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,0,"At the Duke's palace in Athens, Theseus and Hippolyta are attended by Philostrate, Master of Revels (a.k.a. royal party planner), and the usual train of lords and attendants."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,1,"Hippolyta notes to Theseus that the lovers' story is strange, and Theseus dismisses it as ""more strange than true."""
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,2,"He points out that lovers, poets, and madmen have something in common—they're all nuts."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,3,Hippolyta challenges Theseus's cynical view—the youths' stories all matched each other's without contradiction. The story seems to have no holes and she still thinks it strange but interesting.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,4,"The two young pairs—Lysander and Hermia, and Demetrius and Helena—enter the scene, and the Duke greets them by wishing them joy in the days ahead."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,5,"Lysander returns the sentiment, saying that they all wish Theseus and Hippolyta joy in their daily lives—in their walks, at their meals, and, of course, in their bed."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,6,Theseus wonders what entertainment they can have to wear away the three hours that still stand between him and his wedding night.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,7,"He calls on Philostrate, who hands him a list of all the available entertainments for the evening."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,8,"Theseus reads the list: They won't hear the Athenian eunuch singing of the battle with the Centaurs because he's already told that story to Hippolyta about his kinsman, Hercules. (According to Plutarch's ""Life of Theseus,"" Hercules and Theseus were related.)"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,9,"Nor will they hear how Orpheus, the Thracian singer, was torn to bits by the Bacchanals (followers of the riotous god Bacchus) in the middle of an orgiastic frenzy, since Theseus saw this played when he last conquered Thebes."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,10,"Theseus doesn't want to hear the Muses mourn the death of Learning either, because it sounds like it requires some intellectual attention. He states that intellectualizing doesn't befit a wedding ceremony."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,11,"Finally, the Duke comes to the title of the Mechanicals' play: A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus and his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth. Theseus delights in how silly these opposites (tedious and brief; tragical and mirthful) seem, and chooses this as the night's entertainment."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,12,"Philostrate tries to convince Theseus that, though the play is ten words long, it's played so badly that it's ten words too much. The language is stupid, the actors are terrible, and worse, the tragic parts bring tears all right, but more from laughter than from sorrow."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,13,Theseus asks Philostrate who will put on the play. Snobby Philostrate replies that it is to be performed by a group of Athenian workmen who have never labored their brains until now.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,14,"Brain Snack: Shakespeare's dad, John, was a craftsman (a glove-maker, to be exact)."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,15,Theseus wants to hear the play and Philostrate can't sway him. Theseus thinks no play can be bad if it is done out of duty and love for him.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,16,"Hippolyta worries that they've stressed out Philostrate, and the play is bound to be terrible. Theseus soothes her: the worse the play, the kinder they'll be, and everyone will be better off for the lies and mutual deception. He honors the effort of commoners, even if it doesn't always pan out. He accepts their intentions graciously."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,17,"After Theseus's speech to Hippolyta, Philostrate enters to present Quince, who will deliver the prologue."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,18,Quince butchers the prologue to the play by reading it as one big run-on sentence.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,19,"Quince tries to welcome the audience and ask their forgiveness for the humbleness of the play (as Shakespeare often did), but instead he introduces himself by telling the audience that the players offend with their goodwill. It only gets worse from there."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,20,"Theseus accepts Quince's fumbles in stride, saying the players don't stand on points (meaning punctuation, but also theatrical formalities)."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,21,"Lysander and Hippolyta make some snarky comments, but again Theseus replies that the prologue was like a tangled chain, messed up but not really broken."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,22,"Pyramus, Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion arrive on stage, and the prologue continues."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,23,"Quince introduces all of the players and the part they're meant to play. He also explains why each player is there: the wall through which they talk, the moonshine by which they see, etc."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,24,"Quince summarizes the play's action: Pyramus and Thisbe are two lovers who are kept apart, but they conference secretly through a hole in a wall and agree that by moonlight that they'll meet at Ninus's tomb. Thisbe arrives first, but is frightened off by a lion. In running away, she leaves behind her cape, and the lion bloodies it by tearing at it. Pyramus then shows up, a bit late, to find Thisbe's bloody cape. Pyramus is sure his lover is dead, so he draws his sword and kills himself. Thisbe then comes out of hiding in a mulberry bush and, finding her lover slain, pulls his sword out and kills herself too."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,25,"Now that he has finished the prologue, Quince will let the players take over."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,26,"Snout introduces himself as a Wall, who will help the lovers talk to each other through a little gap. (To be help the audience, he points out all the parts of his costume that indicate he's a wall.)"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,27,"In the audience, Theseus mentions he couldn't ask for a wall to speak better. Demetrius agrees this is the wittiest wall he's ever heard talk, especially because it's the only one."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,28,"Bottom comes in as Pyramus, and though he doesn't mess up his lines, he doesn't need to since they're already so absurd. Example: ""The night is very black, and is the time when it isn't day."""
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,29,"Pyramus asks the Wall to show him the little gap that he can speak through, and Snout holds up his fingers in an O shape to provide such a gap."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,30,"Seeing no Thisbe beyond the gap, Pyramus curses the Wall."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,31,Theseus comments that perhaps the wall should curse back.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,32,"Bottom breaks character and says to the Duke that really Thisbe has just missed her cue, but she'll be there soon."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,33,"Sure enough, Thisbe comes up, lamenting that the wall separates her and Pyramus."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,34,"Pyramus recites his lines, which are all messed up. For example, the names Cephalus and Procris become Shafalus and Procrus, and Ninus's tomb is mistaken as Ninny's tomb."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,35,"When Pyramus asks Thisbe to kiss him through the hole in the Wall, Thisbe replies, ""I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all."" (Yep, Shakespeare is cracking a dirty joke here. Come to think of it, it's a lot like Chaucer's joke in ""The Miller's Tale,"" where Absolon thinks he's going to give Alisoun a juicy smack on the lips but accidentally kisses her bare bottom instead.)"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,36,"The lovers have agreed to meet at ""Ninny's"" tomb."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,37,The Wall then speaks up and excuses himself—his part is over.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,38,"Hippolyta dismisses it all as the silliest stuff she's ever heard, but Theseus chides her that even the best in theater is only a shadow of reality. The worst don't need to be any worse than that, if we only lend them a little imagination. If we imagine the players as they imagine themselves, they might come out as excellent men after all."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,39,"Lion and Moonshine enter, and Lion explains that he doesn't mean to scare the ladies, who would be afraid of even a mouse. If the women are scared, they need only remember that he's actually Snug the joiner, not a real lion."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,40,"Theseus commends him for being so thoughtful about the ladies, and the rest of the crowd heckles Lion."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,41,"Moonshine speaks up, saying that the lantern he carries is meant to be the moon, and that he is the man in the moon."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,42,"Theseus notes that this is the worst blunder yet; if this is the man in the moon, then he should be in the lantern. As the nobles all say sarcastic things, Lysander bids the moon to continue his speech."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,43,"Moonshine repeats that he is the man in the moon, the thorn bush he has with him is his thorn bush, and the dog his dog."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,44,"Thisbe enters, Lion makes a little roar, and Thisbe runs off as the Lion chews on the cape she's left behind."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,45,"The royal company teases that the Lion has roared well, Thisbe has run well, and the Moon has shone extremely well."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,46,"Pyramus enters and thanks the sweet moon for its ""sunny beams."" Pyramus then delivers an overly dramatic monologue about finding Thisbe's bloody cape."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,47,"Theseus quips that if you took this emotion portrayed by Bottom and combined with your best friend dying, then you might begin to look sad. In other words, he's so far from seeming sad, it's, well...sad. The acting is so bad, Hippolyta pities him in spite of herself."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,48,"Meanwhile, Pyramus is killing himself with much flourish. After delivering the brilliant line ""Now die, die, die, die, die,"" Pyramus dies."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,49,"The gallery of noblesoffer more snarky play-by-play comments, then ""Thisbe"" comes in to end the play."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,50,"Thisbe is all ""woe is me"" in a comically tragic style, mourning her lover's lily lips, cherry nose, and yellow cheeks."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,51,"Thisbe kills herself with an ""Adieu, adieu, adieu,"" and the peanut gallery notes that Moonshine, Lion, and Wall are left to bury the dead."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,52,"Bottom, who should be dead as Pyramus, sits up and assures the audience that Wall is actually down, and he asks if they'd like to hear the play's epilogue, or see a dance."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,53,"Theseus steps out of this quickly—really, no epilogue is necessary since everyone's dead and no one's to blame. He asks to see the dance instead, and so there's a dance (called the Bergormask)."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,54,"Theseus says the clock has struck midnight, and sends the lovers to bed, declaring it's ""almost fairy time."""
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,55,"Theseus says ""nighty night"" to everyone and announces that the marriage celebrations will continue on for a fortnight (two weeks)."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,56,"All exit.[Note: some places call this a scene break. We're going with Folger, who doesn't, so... on with the show.]"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,57,"Puck comes onto the stage with a broom. (Remember how we told you that, in English folklore, Puck spends his time helping people with their household chores?)"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,58,Puck talks about all the scary things that happen at night (like lions and wolves coming out after humans have gone to bed).
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,59,"Puck notes that nighttime is also the realm of the walking dead, wandering from their graves into churchyards, as well as the time for the fairies to frolic."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,60,"Still, Puck declares that he's a (mostly) friendly spirit who's in the habit of blessing households."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,61,Puck sweeps the dust from Theseus's threshold and promises that nothing will disturb the house.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,62,"The Fairy King and Queen (Oberon and Titania) enter, followed by their entourage. They ""bless"" the house by flying around and chanting a little rhyming verse while doing an aerial fairy dance."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,63,"Oberon orders all the fairies to flit through the house, and bless the master bed so that all the children that come of it will be fortunate and lucky. He promises that all three couples will be happy and remain in love. Furthermore, their babies won't be ugly and won't have any scars or defects. (Seriously.)[Note: the rest is usually referred to as the epilogue. Once again, Folger puts it all in one scene, so who are we to disagree?]"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,64,"Puck closes the play by addressing us, the audience, directly: He announces that if we don't like the play, the best way to remedy the situation is to pretend it's only been a dream."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,65,"Instead of cursing the players for a bad play, we should forgive them. Finally, he asks for applause if we the audience accept his apologies. All can be certain that Robin (as he calls himself) will make amends before long (presumably, with the performance of another play)."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,8,66,The End.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,0,"In an enchanted wood, we meet a ""puck"" (mischievous sprite) named Robin Goodfellow. (Note: In some editions of the play, he's referred to simply as ""Puck."" We use Puck and Robin interchangeably in our discussion.)"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,"Puck greets a fairy, who says she's been busy wandering ""over hill, over dale, / Thorough bush, thorough brier, / Over park, over pale."" Translation: She flies around the woods running errands for the Fairy Queen (Titania)."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,"The fairy announces that she needs to collect some more dewdrops and deposit pearls in some flowers because her boss, the Fairy Queen is on her way and she wants the place to look nice."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,3,"After this lovely and enchanting speech, the fairy insults Puck by calling him a ""lob"" of spirits, which is basically means that Puck is the hillbilly of the spirit world."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,4,"Puck snaps back that the Fairy King (Oberon) is also having a fairy party that night, so the Fairy Queen better watch her back and stay out of Oberon's way. (We're sensing some tension here, kids.)"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,5,"Pucks says that Titania and Oberon have been fighting over a ""lovely boy stol'n from an Indian king."" Oberon wants the kid to be his personal page (errand boy), but Titania wants him for herself—she spends all her time crowning him with flowers and doting on him."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,6,"We learn that Titania and Oberon are supposed to be a couple, but they don't even spend time together anymore."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,7,"The fairy recognizes Puck and tells us all about his infamous pranks: frightening village girls, ruining batches of homemade butter, leading people astray as they travel at night, and so on."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,8,"Puck brags that his boss, Oberon, loves his pranks and tricks. Puck also tells us about the good times he's had making old ladies spill their drinks and fall on the ground (by pretending to be a stool and then disappearing when they try to sit)."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,9,"Just then, Titania and Oberon enter from opposite sides of the stage and face off like a couple of cowboys at the O.K. Corral instead of the King and Queen of Fairy Land."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,10,Titania orders her fairies to scram and tells us that she's no longer sharing a bed with Oberon.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,11,Titania accuses Oberon of sleeping around with other women—she knows for a fact that Oberon disguised himself as a shepherd so he could hook up with a country girl.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,12,"Titania then accuses Oberon of being Hippolyta's lover. (Remember, Hippolyta is the Queen of the Amazons and she's about to marry Theseus.)"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,13,"Oberon fights back. He accuses Titania of having the hots for Theseus and of stealing Theseus away from a bunch of his other mistresses (Perigouna, Aegles, Ariadne, and Antiopa, to name a few)."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,14,"Titania says he's just jealous—so jealous that he hasn't let her and her fairies do any of their special nature dances since spring, which has the natural world all messed up. Because he keeps interrupting their rituals, it's been windy and foggy, and the rivers are all flooding, which is causing serious damage to the local crops.We learn that Titania and Oberon's big feud has thrown the natural world into chaos. Lately, it's been windy, foggy, and the rivers are all flooding, which is causing serious damage to the local crops."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,15,"Brain Snack: Some literary scholars (like Gail Kern Paster and Skiles Howard) say that this is a reference to how, in Europe during the 1590s, seriously bad weather ruined crops, which caused food shortages, which, in turn, caused inflation, hunger, disease, and so on."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,16,"Oberon says Titania has the power to fix everything, if she would only turn over the ""little changeling boy"" to him."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,17,"Brain Snack: A ""changeling"" is a child that's been secretly switched with another, usually by mischievous fairies."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,18,"Titania claims that she didn't steal the kid from anyone. She says she's raising the boy as a favor to his dead mother, a human who was a good friend of Titania's back in India. Oberon should just get over it because Titania's never going to give up her foster son."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,19,Oberon slyly asks Titania how long she plans to be in the woods. She says she'll stay until Theseus is married.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,20,"Titania invites Oberon to join her in the fairies' dancing and moonlight revels, but Oberon claims that he'll only participate if he can have the boy."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,21,Titania says she wouldn't turn over the little boy for Oberon's whole kingdom and exits before they get into another fight.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,22,Oberon vows that Titania won't leave the woods until he pays her back.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,23,"Oberon calls Puck to him and tells him a little story. One night, Oberon was watching a mermaid riding on a dolphin's back when he saw Cupid try to hit a royal virgin with one of his arrows. Cupid missed his target and instead hit a little white flower (a pansy), which then turned purple."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,24,"Brain Snack: Most literary critics agree that the royal virgin Cupid was aiming his arrow at is a shout-out to Shakespeare's monarch, Queen Elizabeth I. Elizabeth never married and made a very big deal about being a virgin queen."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,25,"Anyway, back to pansies. Oberon asks Puck to bring him the flower because it has magical properties. When the juice of the flower is squeezed on a sleeping person's eyelids, it enchants the sleeper to fall madly in love with the first thing he or she sees upon waking. (It's sort of like Love Potion Number 9. Go to ""Symbolism, Imagery, Allegory"" for more about this.)"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,26,"Puck fetches the flower and Oberon announces he'll put the juice on Titania's eyes. He hopes she'll fall madly in love with some awful, ugly beast. In her lovesickness, he can convince her to give him the little boy. Once his master plan is accomplished, Oberon will remove the spell."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,27,"Oberon hears some people approaching and announces that, since he's invisible, he can stay and listen to the conversation."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,28,Demetrius enters the scene with Helena tagging along behind him.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,29,"He's searching for Lysander and Hermia, presumably to kill Lysander and win Hermia's heart."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,30,"Demetrius can't find Hermia, and he really wishes Helena would quit stalking him."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,31,"Helena says it's Demetrius's fault that she's chasing him. If he wasn't so scrumptious-looking, she wouldn't bother him."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,32,Demetrius tells her flat-out that he does not and cannot love her.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,33,"Helena announces that she's going to follow him around like a ""dog"" forever."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,34,Demetrius says that virgins shouldn't run around the woods at night throwing themselves at men who don't love them.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,35,"Helena declares that it's not dark out because Demetrius's face shines like a light. Also, she's never alone when she's with him because he's her whole world."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,36,"Demetrius isn't about to take on the role of her protector in the woods. He says he'll run away from her, hide in the bushes, and leave her to be eaten by a wild beast. Ah, love."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,37,Helena tells us she's bucking traditional gender roles by chasing after Demetrius. She doesn't think it's fair that guys can be aggressive when it comes to love but girls can't. (Hmm. Is she talking about the fact that Theseus won Hippolyta by conquering the Amazons?)
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,38,Demetrius runs off and Helena chases after him.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,39,Meanwhile Oberon has been watching the scene in disgust.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,40,He thinks Demetrius is a jerk and decides Demetrius needs some love juice squeezed in his eyes so he'll fall for Helena.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,41,Puck returns with the magic pansy.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,42,Oberon describes the bank of flowers where Titania sleeps and says he's off to sprinkle the potion on her eyelids.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,43,Oberon gives some of the love juice to Puck and tells him to put some drops on Demetrius's eyes—Puck will know who Demetrius is because he's human and he's wearing Athenian clothes.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,44,Oberon and Puck agree to meet again soon.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,0,Titania instructs her fairies to dance and sing her to sleep.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,"Afterwards, her attendants can go back to their fairy work and disappear."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,Oberon slips in and manages to get the pansy juice onto Titania eyes before running off.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,3,Lysander and Hermia come tripping in after Oberon exits. They're lost so they decide to stop for the night and rest.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,4,Lysander wants to sleep close to Hermia but she tells him to back off because they're not married yet.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,5,Lysander tries to sweet-talk Hermia but she's not having it.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,6,They fall asleep separately.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,7,Puck ambles onto the stage.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,8,Puck thinks Lysander is Demetrius (because he's wearing Athenian clothes) and sprinkles the love juice on his eyelids.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,9,Puck runs off to tell Oberon.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,10,Then Demetrius runs onto the stage with Helena chasing after him. Demetrius tells her to scram but she refuses.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,11,"Demetrius exits the stage, leaving Helena to roam around on her own."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,12,"Helena, finally weary of running after Demetrius, wanders alone for a bit, talking to herself about how poorly she measures up to Hermia. Hermia's eyes are so much brighter—probably, Helena thinks, because she hasn't spent as much time crying as Helena has. In the middle of her pity party, she notices Lysander on the ground. Worried that he's dead, she shakes him awake."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,13,Lysander takes one look at Helena and falls in love at first sight. Then he says he's going to kill Demetrius.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,14,"Helena is confused and thinks Lysander is mocking her, which adds to the indignity of Demetrius not loving her. She exits, certain that she's being punked."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,15,Lysander says he never wants to see Hermia again and deserts her while she's sleeping.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,16,"Hermia wakes up from a horrible dream. Thinking Lysander is still sleeping near her, she recounts the nightmare: she thought a serpent was eating her heart while Lysander stood by smiling."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,17,Hermia then realizes that Lysander's not there.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,18,"She panics and runs off looking for him, promising she'll either find her love or kill herself."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,0,"In another part of the wood, Oberon wonders if Titania has awoken from her slumber. He's hoping that she laid her eyes on a vile beast."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,Enter Puck with the answer.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,2,"He tells Oberon that a crew of craftsmen entered the grove where Titania was sleeping to practice their play for Theseus's wedding. Puck found Bottom to be the dullest, so he transformed his head into that of a donkey. Titania woke up and fell in love with the donkey-Bottom hybrid."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,3,Oberon thinks this is hilarious—everything has worked out better than he could've imagined.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,4,"The Fairy King asks Puck if put the love juice in the Athenian man's eyes and Puck says, yep, he sure did."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,5,Demetrius and Hermia enter and Oberon realizes that Puck put the love juice in the wrong Athenian man's eyes.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,6,"Hermia is livid that Lysander abandoned her while she was sleeping. Then she accuses Demetrius of killing her fiancé, which he doesn't exactly deny, even though we know he hasn't killed anyone."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,7,Hermia flips out and curses Demetrius.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,8,"Demetrius says she's getting her bloomers in a knot for no reason—he hasn't killed Lysander, nor does he have any reason to believe Lysander is dead."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,9,"Hermia wants Demetrius's assurance that Lysander is okay. Demetrius is all, ""What will you give me in exchange?"""
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,10,Sassy Hermia says that in exchange she'll promise to never see him again. This doesn't sound like much of a bargain and Demetrius admits that he's getting nowhere fast.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,11,"All this pursuing has made Demetrius sad and sleepy, so he lies down for a nap."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,12,"Meanwhile, Oberon is busy pointing out that Puck got the wrong guy. Oberon tells Puck to go find Helena in the woods, and use some magic to bring her to Demetrius's sight."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,13,Puck exits.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,14,"Oberon says a little verse over the sleeping Demetrius, intending to make the young man fall in love with Helena (with the help of some love juice) once Demetrius awakens."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,15,"Puck leads Helena to Demetrius, with Lysander begging at her heels. Oberon and Puck are going to watch what happens for a while, and they hope the ruckus will wake up Demetrius."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,16,"Meanwhile, Lysander tries to convince Helena that he loves her."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,17,Helena is ticked off because Lysander is supposed to be in love with her friend Hermia.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,18,"Lysander points out that Hermia's dad wants her to marry Demetrius, anyway."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,19,"Just then, Demetrius wakes up, sees Helena, and declares that she's a goddess."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,20,"Now Helena really loses it, thinking that both men are mocking her for their amusement."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,21,Lysander and Demetrius bicker over who should get Helena.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,22,Demetrius announces that Hermia is approaching.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,23,"Hermia can't see anything in the dark woods, but she follows Lysander's voice."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,24,"Once she arrives, she asks Lysander why he left her alone in the woods while she was sleeping."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,25,Lysander declares that he no longer loves Hermia and that his heart belongs to Helena.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,26,Lysander says he thought leaving Hermia sleeping alone in the woods in the middle of the night was a clear enough message that he hates her.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,27,"Helena thinks that Hermia is in on some big, elaborate joke designed to make her look silly. She accuses Hermia of betraying the girls' long friendship. They even used to embroider together! The nerve!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,28,Hermia is shocked to hear that Helena thinks she's been betrayed—Hermia actually thinks Helena must be the one doing the teasing and betraying.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,29,The ex-friends continue to argue.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,30,"Helena throws up her hands and tells them they can go ahead and keep up the act. Helena assumes they mean to ""chronicle"" it, the Elizabethan equivalent of putting it up on Facebook, so that they can all laugh about it later."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,31,Helena doesn't want to stick around just to be teased—she'd rather die.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,32,"Hearing Helena's plan to take off, Lysander interjects, calling Helena ""my love, my life, my soul."""
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,33,"Hermia chides Lysander, thinking he's teasing Helena."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,34,"Demetrius threatens Lysander, who again swears his love to Helena. The boys then get into a discussion about who loves Helena. Hermia asks Lysander what this is all about."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,35,"Lysander makes his feelings for Hermia clear by using a racial slur: ""Away, you Ethiop!"""
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,36,"Hermia hangs onto Lysander, all confused, as he calls her a string of nasty things, including a ""Tartar"" (which is a reference to the Mongolian people of Central Asia, not the gross stuff that builds up on your teeth). All the while Demetrius accuses Lysander of being a coward, pretending to be held back by Hermia instead of fighting."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,37,"Lysander goes back to his challenge against Demetrius, saying that he'll keep his word and fight him."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,38,"We interrupt this soap opera to bring you a brain snack and some words of encouragement: If you're feeling like your head is going to explode and you're having a hard time keeping track of who's who, you're not alone. The scene is confusing and the four young lovers seem indistinguishable for a reason—Shakespeare is basically telling us that all lovers are alike. Now, back to our program."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,39,"Lysander asks if he should ""hurt [Hermia], strike her, kill her dead?"" to prove he no longer loves her, but concedes that, even though he hates Hermia, he won't kill her."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,40,Hermia finally gets it.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,41,"Instead of turning on the man who scorns her, Hermia turns on the woman he's chosen over her, the woman who has been her closest friend since childhood. Hermia accuses Helena of stealing Lysander."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,42,Helena is also upset and thinking Hermia must still be joking. She calls Hermia a counterfeit and a puppet.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,43,"Hermia takes great offense. Though it seems Helena meant to call her a puppet (as in a doll with no feelings), Hermia interprets the puppet comment as a jab at how short she is."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,44,Hermia irrationally reasons that Helena has won the love of both men by flaunting her superior height and making Hermia look like a dwarf in comparison. (Seriously.)
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,45,"Hermia points out that she may be short, but she is still tall enough to scratch out Helena's eyes."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,46,"Scandalized, Helena pleads with the men to protect her from Hermia."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,47,Helena tries to soothe Hermia by saying she still loves her and never did her wrong. Well...except that one time when she told Demetrius about Hermia's secret plan to elope with Lysander.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,48,Helena now accepts the wrong that she's done. She'd like to just get back to Athens and forget the whole thing.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,49,"Hermia, still angry, says nothing is stopping Helena from going. It's clear, though, that Helena's heart is still with Demetrius."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,50,"Lysander says he'll protect Helena from Hermia, which starts the whole mess up again."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,51,"Now Helena says that Hermia was always feisty when they were younger and, though she's little, she's fierce."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,52,"Hermia flares up again at being called ""little"" and tries to get at Helena. Again. Lysander calls Hermia a dwarf and tells her to get lost. Demetrius thinks Lysander should lay off trying to protect Helena because she doesn't like him."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,53,"Lysander points out that Hermia isn't holding him back now. He suggests to Demetrius that they ""step outside"" and settle this thing once and for all. They exit to fight."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,54,Now Helena and Hermia can catfight alone. Helena decides she's a faster runner than Hermia and flees rather than face Hermia's fists (and eye-scratching fingernails).
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,55,Hermia chases after her. The two women exit.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,56,"Finally, we're back to Oberon and Puck."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,57,Oberon yells at Puck for screwing things up so badly.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,58,Oberon asks if Puck sprinkled the love juice on the wrong guy's eyes on purpose.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,59,"Puck assures Oberon that he's not at fault—all Oberon told him to do was find a guy dressed like an Athenian, which he did. Anyway, he's glad for his mistake because it's much funnier this way—full of betrayal, mayhem, general human foolishness, and murder threats."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,60,"Oberon, knowing the competitive males are looking for some place to fight, tells Puck to make the night overcast, so the angry men can't see each other. He instructs Puck to lure each man in a different direction by imitating his enemy's voice."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,61,"Oberon then gives Puck another herb, an antidote to the love juice, and tells him that the boys will tire eventually and go to sleep."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,62,"He tells Puck to drop the remedy herb onto Lysander's eyes, so he'll be cured of his love for Helena. When everybody wakes up, these quarrels will seem like a silly dream. Lysander will love Hermia again, and Demetrius will still love Helena."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,63,"After this, the lovers can go home to Athens and live happily ever after."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,64,"While Puck is busy preventing fights and un-enchanting Lysander, Oberon will go beg the still-bewitched Titania for the Indian boy."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,65,"Once she's given up the boy, Oberon will release Titania from her enchanted love of Bottom. Thus, the entire mess will be fixed."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,66,"Puck agrees this plan must be accomplished quickly, because night will be over soon. Ghosts are returning to their graves, and all the wicked things that night allows are coming to a close."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,67,"Oberon points out that, although some spirits and ghosts can only come out at night, he and Puck can go about their business during day or night. Still, Oberon wants the job done already—no delays."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,68,"The Fairy King leaves and Puck is left alone to tend to his business, promising to lead the young men up and down and every which way."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,69,"Lysander then enters. Puck, in Demetrius's voice, challenges Lysander to find more steady ground on which to fight. Lysander exits, following the voice he thinks belongs to Demetrius."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,70,"Now Demetrius enters, asking where Lysander is hiding. Puck, putting on Lysander's voice, eggs on Demetrius, promising to whip him. Thus he leads Demetrius off with his false voice."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,71,"Lysander, back on stage, wonders where on earth Demetrius has gone. Still, Lysander is now exhausted and lies on the ground to get some rest. As he's falling asleep, he promises to hunt Demetrius down in the light of day."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,72,Lysander sleeps.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,73,"Demetrius and Puck come back onto the stage, with Puck leading Demetrius around using Lysander's voice. Demetrius still seeks Lysander, but can't see him. Demetrius is tired too, so he tells Lysander (Puck's voice) to get lost, with the promise that they'll fight in the daylight."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,74,Demetrius also sleeps.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,75,"Helena then enters, pleading with night to end quickly. In daylight, she'll go back to Athens and escape the other three Athenians who hate her so much."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,76,"Finally, Hermia comes back on stage, claiming she has never been so tired or so sad. She can't go on, and will rest here, though she prays the heavens will protect Lysander if Demetrius means to fight him. She too goes to sleep."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,77,"Puck, with all four youngsters asleep, can now begin his work."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,78,"He says a little rhyme, and squeezes the remedy onto Lysander's eyes. Now Lysander will love Hermia again when he wakes, and each man will take the woman that is right for him."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,0,"As Titania sleeps on a cushy bed of flowers, the Mechanicals (craftsmen) enter the woods to practice their play, Pyramus and Thisbe."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,"Bottom points out that the play has a lot of content that isn't appropriate for Theseus and his bride, like the part where Pyramus draws his sword and kills himself."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,Starveling suggests they just leave the killing out (despite the fact that the double-suicide is the whole point of the play).
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,3,"Bottom comes up with a marvelous solution. Quince should write a prologue to let all the delicate ladies know that the action isn't real and the characters are only actors. If the women know Pyramus isn't Pyramus, but really only Bottom the weaver, they'll be comforted."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,4,"Then the Mechanicals quibble over whether the play's lines should be written in the usual style of verse, a line of eight syllables alternating with six. Bottom suggests they write it in the style of eight and eight."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,5,Snout then brings up another question: Will the lion in the play frighten the ladies?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,6,"Starveling admits the lion frightens him. Bottom adds his two cents, saying the group should think twice before bringing a lion in among ladies."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,7,"Brain Snack: According to the editors of the Norton Shakespeare, this might be an allusion to something that happened at a real-life court entertainment in 1594, when a tame lion was supposed to pull a chariot across the stage. The lion was replaced by an African man so the audience wouldn't be scared."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,8,"To remedy the situation, Bottom suggests that the actor playing the lion should show his face through his costume. Also, Snug, in the Lion's costume, should tell the ladies that he's not really a lion."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,9,"With that settled, Quince brings up two more issues. They need moonlight, because Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,10,"Quince suggests that maybe they could have the guy playing the moon carry a lantern, and be dressed up as the man in the moon, who usually has a dog with him in folklore. (Dogs on stage in Shakespeare's time were guaranteed comic gold.)"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,11,"The last problem is that they'll need a wall, because, without one, there's no hole in the wall through which Pyramus and Thisbe can talk, which is also a major part of the story."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,12,"The group decides to have a man dress up as a plastered wall. Also, the guy playing the ""part"" of the wall should use his fingers to make an O-shaped hole so Pyramus and Thisbe can whisper to each other through it."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,13,"With all the important casting and staging stuff out of the way, the Mechanicals begin to rehearse."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,14,"Puck sneaks up to the scene, delighted to have so many fools around. He decides to watch and participate."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,15,"The men begin to rehearse the play with lots of misspeaking. Flute, as Thisbe, says all his lines at once, instead of waiting for cues. (This play's going to be a disaster.)"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,16,"Just as the Mechanicals are clearing up that issue, Bottom comes back onto stage. He now has a donkey's head where his own should be, thanks to one of Puck's tricks."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,17,"As you might expect, this donkey-Bottom hybrid is frightening. All the other men run away in a panic. Puck follows them, leading the Mechanicals in circles about the dark woods and chasing them in the guise of scary things: a headless bear, hounds, and flames."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,18,Snout informs Bottom that he has been transformed.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,19,"Bottom doesn't believe it and calls Snout an ""ass-head."""
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,20,"Quince comes back, also claiming Bottom has changed. Bottom then announces that he sees that they're just trying to make ""an ass"" of him."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,21,"Yep. This is a case of dramatic irony all right. Go to ""Symbolism, Imagery, Allegory"" if you want to know more about it."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,22,"Bottom insists he won't move from this place, and will even sing a song to prove he isn't scared."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,23,Bottom's singing wakes Titania (who has recently had the magic love juice sprinkled in her eyes).
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,24,Titania sees Bottom and instantly falls head over heels in love...with an ass.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,25,Titania begs Bottom to sing some more.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,26,"Bottom, a little taken aback, tells her she has no reason to love him. He does add that reason and love aren't related these days. He philosophizes on this for a bit, and Titania praises him for being both wise and beautiful."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,27,"Bottom says he isn't wise, but only needs enough wit to get out of these woods. Titania informs Bottom that he'll stay whether he wants to or not. She loves him and he will remain with her."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,28,"Titania promises to have her fairies tend to him – they'll bring him jewels from the deep sea, he'll sleep on flower petals, and she'll rid him of his ""mortal grossness"" so that he'll be as airy as the fairy spirits."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,29,"Titania summons her fairies: Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,30,"She charges them to tend to her new lover with all the best nature has to offer. The fairies bring in grapes, figs, mulberries, bee's honey, and glowworms to light her bedchamber. In addition, the fairies should fan the moonbeams away from Bottom with the wings plucked off of butterflies."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,31,Bottom then does what Bottom does best—he rambles on and cracks a bunch of lame jokes.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,32,"Titania orders the fairies to bring Bottom to her sleeping space, and to keep him quiet as they do. She also comments that the moon looks sad, likely because someone is being denied love (or sex)."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,0,"Elsewhere in Athens, a group of ""Mechanicals"" (a.k.a., craftsmen) meet up to practice a play they plan to perform at Theseus and Hippolyta's upcoming wedding."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,"Individually, they are Peter Quince the carpenter, Snug the joiner, Bottom the weaver, Flute the bellows mender, Snout the tinker, and Starveling the tailor. ( FYI—All of the men's names are a clever play on their professions. You can read more on this by going to ""Tools of Characterization."")"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,2,"Quince is the brains of the operation, and he'll lead the Mechanicals as they rehearse and then perform the chosen play, The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,3,"Brain Snack: Pyramus and Thisbe is a story from Roman mythology about two young lovers who die tragically after running off to elope. Sound familiar? It's one of the major literary sources for Romeo and Juliet, which Shakespeare wrote around the same time as A Midsummer Night's Dream. Shakespeare got the story of Pyramus and Thisbe from Book 4 of Ovid's Metamorphoses."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,4,"Bottom, who is definitely not the brains of the operation, announces that it sounds like a happy piece of work for the wedding night. We're guessing that Bottom missed the whole ""cruel death"" part."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,5,Quince proceeds to assign each man his role.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,6,"Bottom is to be ""Pyramus,"" the male lead. Bottom asks if Pyramus is a lover or a tyrant. Quince responds that Pyramus is a lover who dies for love. Bottom promises to bring the audience to tears, though he thinks he'd be better at playing a tyrant. He's also sure he could put on a good Hercules. Bottom delivers some really bad poetry to prove the point."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,7,Quince keeps reading down the role assignments.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,8,"Flute will be ""Thisbe."" Unfortunately, Thisbe is not the wandering knight Flute had hoped, but a woman in love (remember, in Shakespeare's day, women's roles were played by young men). Flute claims he can't do this role because he's sure his beard will grow in soon. Anyway, Quince points out that the peach fuzz is irrelevant; Flute will play Thisbe in a mask. Deal with it."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,9,"Bottom heartily volunteers to play Thisbe, too, and claims he can make his voice tiny, womanly, and beautiful."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,10,"Quince continues to assign the roles: Starveling will be Thisbe's mother and Quince, her father. Snout will play Pyramus's father, and Snug will play the part of the lion, which is nothing but roaring."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,11,"After hearing about the roaring, Bottom offers to play the lion, too, as he can roar quite fearsomely. Still, the terrifying noises might upset the ladies, so Bottom volunteers to roar as gently as a dove."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,12,Quince cuts off all of this nonsense: Bottom must play Pyramus because he's the prettiest and most gentlemanly of the group.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,13,Then there's a long discussion about what kind of beard Bottom should have for the role.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,14,"Bottom wonders if he should wear a ""French-crown-colour beard"" (a.k.a. a beard that's the color of a French gold coin or ""crown"")."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,15,"Quince takes this opportunity to crack a dirty joke about there being so many bald ""French crowns"" in the world. (This is a reference to ""the French disease,"" syphilis, a STD that causes your hair to fall out if it's left untreated.)"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,16,"After this little exchange, Quince tells his crew to memorize their lines and meet in the woods tomorrow night. Since it's private and shielded from the Athenian court, it's the perfect rehearsal spot."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,17,"Bottom confirms the plans, as well as his commitment to act obscenely (we don't think that word means what he thinks it means), and the craftsmen depart."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,18,"Brain Snack: When Shakespeare wrote A Midsummer Night's Dream, craftsmen didn't usually run around putting on plays like this. Back in early medieval England, though, guilds of craftsmen got together each year and put on plays for the Corpus Christi festival. So, Shakespeare's ""Mechanicals"" are a shout-out to the craftsmen who moonlighted as amateur actors each year."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,0,"We meet Duke Theseus at his swanky palace in Athens and learn that he's going to marry Hippolyta (Queen of the Amazons) in four days, during the new moon."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,1,"Our groom-to-be is in a VERY big hurry to enjoy his wedding night, but time is passing way too slowly for Theseus, who lashes out at the moon for being a slowpoke."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,2,"Hippolyta is more reasonable. She assures Theseus that four days will go by in a jiffy and says the moon will ""behold the night of [their] solemnities."" (Translation: When the moon looks down on Theseus and Hippolyta on their wedding night, it's going to get an eyeful.)"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,3,"Theseus sends this guy, Philostrate, the Master of the Revels, to go out into the streets of Athens and get the youth of the city to party so that the time passes quickly."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,4,"Brain Snack: In Shakespeare's day, the Master of the Revels was the title of the royal court's official party planner. Basically, the Master of the Revels was in charge of hiring entertainers and deciding which plays could be performed on public stages in and around London. He also had the authority to censor plays that were offensive or didn't kiss up to the monarch enough."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,5,"Theseus turns to Hippolyta and promises her that their wedding will be more joyful than the circumstances under which they got engaged. (As every mythology buff knows, Theseus is alluding to the fact that he captured Hippolyta when he conquered her people, the Amazons. We're guessing the wedding will be a much happier occasion.)"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,6,An Athenian man named Egeus shows up and greets Theseus. Egeus has brought along his daughter Hermia and two guys named Lysander and Demetrius.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,7,Egeus is not a happy camper.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,8,"He lodges a formal complaint to the Duke against his disobedient daughter, who refuses to marry Demetrius, the guy Egeus has chosen to be her husband."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,9,"According to Egeus, Hermia's been ""bewitch'd"" by Lysander and refuses to marry Demetrius. (Hmm. Is it just us, or did Desdemona's dad use the same ""this guy put a spell on my daughter"" argument in Othello?)"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,10,"Egeus then cites the wrongs Lysander has committed: Lysander has presented Hermia with various love-tokens, serenaded her by moonlight, and even given her a lock of his hair. (Who does this guy think he is, Romeo?)"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,11,Egeus points out that Hermia is his daughter and therefore his property. Athenian law dictates that Hermia has to marry the guy of his choice... or be put to death.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,12,"Brain Snack: In Shakespeare's England, parents really liked to pick out their kids' spouses. Sometimes, parents even filed lawsuits to try to force their kids into arranged marriages."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,13,"Theseus puts on his Dr. Phil hat and tries to reason with Hermia, but our girl flat-out refuses to marry Demetrius."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,14,Hermia asks the Duke what the worst-case scenario would be if she didn't marry Demetrius.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,15,"Theseus (who is also Athens's resident Judge Judy) says that, if Hermia refuses to marry Demetrius, she has only two other options: 1) Become a celibate nun or 2) Be put to death."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,16,Things aren't looking good for Hermia.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,17,Theseus warns that being a nun is not so great and suggests that Hermia just bite the bullet and marry Demetrius.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,18,Hermia declares she would rather die a virgin than marry a guy she doesn't love.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,19,"Theseus tells her she should really reconsider and gives her four days to declare her own fate. In other words, Hermia has until Theseus and Hippolyta's wedding day to decide if she'll get married, become a nun, or be sent to the chopping block."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,20,"Demetrius tries to get Hermia and Lysander to give in, but Lysander points out that since Hermia's dad loves Demetrius so much, maybe the two of them should get married."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,21,"Lysander defends his right to marry Hermia: he's equal to Demetrius in pedigree, better off financially, and besides, Hermia actually loves him."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,22,"Furthermore, Lysander claims that Demetrius is known to have previously courted Hermia's friend, Helena, who still has a crush on Demetrius."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,23,Theseus says he's heard about this and meant to have a talk with Demetrius about it.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,24,Theseus calls Egeus and Demetrius away with him so he can give them some advice.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,25,"Before the men leave, Theseus advises Hermia to be a good girl and listen to her dad, or deal with Athenian law."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,26,Lysander and Hermia are left to discuss their bad luck.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,27,Hermia is really upset by the whole death/nun ultimatum.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,28,"Lysander tries to take everything in strideand famously declares ""the course of true love never did run smooth."""
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,29,Hermia declares that they should be patient because they're destined to be together.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,30,"Lysander then pipes up that he has a rich, widowed aunt who lives outside of Athens and loves him like a son. They can run away to auntie's house and get hitched because she lives outside the reach of Athenian law. (How convenient.)"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,31,"Hermia agrees to meet Lysander in the woods tomorrow night. From there, they can run off and pull a Romeo and Juliet (a.k.a. elope, not commit a double-suicide)."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,32,Hermia's friend Helena then shows up. Helena's a mess because she loves Demetrius but Demetrius wants to marry Hermia.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,33,"Helena says she wishes she could be more like Hermia—pretty, sweet-voiced, and good at making men fall in love with her."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,34,"Hermia points out she hasn't done much to inspire Demetrius. The more she frowns, curses, and hates him, the more he loves her. Go figure."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,35,"Helena has done the opposite, and Demetrius won't give her the time of day."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,36,Hermia then tells Helena to relax—Demetrius won't be distracted by Hermia anymore because Hermia's going to run off and get hitched to Lysander.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,37,"The lovers explain their plan to Helena: Tomorrow night, they'll meet up in the woods and then run away to get married."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,38,The happy lovers exit after wishing Helena good luck with Demetrius.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,39,"Helena, now alone, feels sorry for herself for being in love with a guy who won't give her the time of day."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,40,Helena tries to understand why Demetrius fell out of love with her (and fell in love with Hermia).
A Midsummer Night's Dream,0,41,Helena decides the best thing to do is tattle to Demetrius that Hermia plans to elope with Lysander. She reasons that she's got nothing to lose and thinks that maybe Demetrius will be so grateful that he'll change his mind and fall in love with her again. (Um. OK.)
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,0,"Now we're back to Titania and Bottom, who are lounging around on a bed of flowers while Titania's fairies wait on them."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,1,"Titania lavishes Bottom with her affection, twiddling his cheeks and kissing his large donkey ears."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,2,Bottom still doesn't know his head has been transformed into that of an ass.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,3,He calls for Peaseblossom to scratch his head and for Cobweb to go kill him a bee and bring back its honey.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,4,"Bottom announces he should go to the barber because he's feeling kind of hairy, and when he's hairy, he feels itchy all over."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,5,"Titania distracts Bottom from these worldly concerns, and asks him if he'd like to hear some music. Bottom says he has a good ear for music, and calls for ""tongs and bones."" (These are old rural musical instruments—the tongs were struck like a triangle, and the bones rattled in the hands, like clappers.)"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,6,Titania asks Bottom if he'd like something to eat.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,7,He asks for oats and hay.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,8,"Titania says she can have a fairy steal some nuts from a squirrel, but he admits he'd rather have dried peas."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,9,"None of it matters, though, because Bottom is feeling very sleepy. Titania tells him to go to sleep and she'll snuggle with him."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,10,"Titania sends all of the fairies away and compares her strange pairing with Bottom to the relationship between the gentle ivy that twists around the ugly, barky elm. (She doesn't say it, but we can assume she's the pretty and delicate half of that metaphor.)"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,11,Titania declares her love for Bottom again and they take a nap together.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,12,"Puck shows up to join Oberon, who's been hanging out, invisible style. Oberon says that earlier, when he found lovesick Titania snuggling with Bottom, he took the opportunity to ask her for the ""changeling child."""
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,13,"Titania, who was busy decorating Bottom's head with flowers, agreed to give him up."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,14,"Since Oberon's now got what he wanted all along (the ""lovely Indian boy""), he decides to release Titania from her spell and orders Puck to remove the ass head from Bottom and make it so that Bottom wakes up and thinks the whole experience has been nothing but a ""dream."""
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,15,"Oberon releases Titania from the spell by touching her eyes with a thing he calls ""Dian's bud"" (probably the same remedy that cured Lysander), which he says is more potent than even Cupid's power."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,16,"Oberon bids Titania to see things as she should, and tells her to awaken, calling her his ""sweet queen."""
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,17,"Titania wakes up immediately and tells him she has had an insane dream that she was in love with a donkey. Oberon points her in the direction of Bottom. She asks how on earth this happened, especially being that she hates the sight of Bottom now."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,18,"Oberon tells Titania to relax; Puck will change Bottom's head back, and he instructs Titania to call up music that will make the five Athenians sleep more soundly than normal."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,19,Puck fixes Bottom's head.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,20,"Oberon takes Titania's hands. They'll rock the young Athenian lovers to sleep on the ground and celebrate their regained friendship tomorrow night, when they'll dance at Duke Theseus's house and bless all the pairs of lovers that will be happily wedded at that time."

A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,34,"The young lovers all awaken and kneel to Theseus. He teases them a little, saying that St. Valentine's day has passed (a day when the birds were supposed to choose their mates), so he wonders why these birds (the youths) are only choosing their mates now."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,35,"Also, Theseus wants to know how the heck these kids ended up asleep together in the wood."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,36,"Lysander begins to reply. He says he doesn't quite know how he got to this spot, but he can explain why they're in the wood. Lysander admits that he and Hermia fled to the wood in an attempt to get out of Athens, where they could escape Athenian law and get married."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,37,"Egeus cuts him off, demanding that Theseus bring the law down on Lysander's head for trying to run off with his daughter."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,38,"Demetrius pipes up and admits that Helena told him of the other pair's plan to steal away to the woods. Demetrius says he followed them into the forest in a fury, and Helena followed him in fancy. However, it seems that Demetrius's love for Hermia has melted.

A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,40,"Theseus thinks everything is turning out for the best. He tells Egeus he's overriding his choice, and the couples (paired off according to their wishes) will be married in the temple at the same time as he and Hippolyta."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,41,Everybody returns to Athens for the weddings.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,42,"As all the grownups leave, Demetrius, Lysander, Helena, and Hermia are left to sort out the night. Demetrius thinks everything is dreamlike and Hermia seems to be seeing double. Helena is just happy to have woken up to find that Demetrius loves her."

A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,44,Demetrius (still charmed) concedes that they must be awake and says they should all recount their dreams on their way back to Athens.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,45,"As the four youths leave, Bottom awakens suddenly, crying out that, when his cue comes, he'll come on stage with his next line. He calls out for his friends, thinking he's still in the play, and realizes that he's been left alone in the wood."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,46,"Bottom tells us he's had a rare vision. He knows he's had a dream, but humans don't have a mind capable of describing how crazy the dream was. Bottom attempts it anyway."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,47,"Bottom decides that, since he can't properly tell the dream, he'll go to Quince and have him write the dream as a ballad. It will be called ""Bottom's Dream,"" as it has no bottom (meaning it's all tangled up and has no narrative grounding or sense) and it's also his name."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,6,48,Bottom concludes that he'll sing the ballad during the play they're putting on for the Duke's wedding. He also decides that the song should be sung during Thisbe's death scene.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,7,0,"Back in Athens, the playacting gang is gathered at Quince's house. They're worried because no one has seen Bottom yet. If he's not around, the play can't go on."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,7,1,Flute announces that certainly they can't perform the play because Bottom has the finest wit of any craftsman in Athens.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,7,2,"Quince announces that Bottom is the paramour of a sweet voice, and Flute points out that he means ""paragon."" (A paramour is a lover—usually in shady circumstances, like someone who's dating a married person; a paragon is the best example of something. They're pretty different.)"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,7,3,"Snug enters the house, announcing that the Duke is coming from the temple with two or three more couples who were just married. Flute laments that, had they been able to perform, they'd no doubt be rich men, earning them at least sixpence a day (a royal pension)."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,7,4,Then Bottom shows up.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,7,5,"He says he can't possibly explain what's happened to him, so they shouldn't bother asking. Then, before anyone replies, he tells them he'll give them every last detail exactly as it happened."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,7,6,"His friends definitely want to know everything, but the story will have to wait."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,7,7,"Since the Duke and Hippolyta are now hitched and have had their wedding cake, it's time for the Mechanicals to perform the play."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,7,8,"Bottom yells for everyone to get ready and tells them not to eat onion or garlic—he wants them to have ""sweet"" breath to make the audience say that they have put on a sweet comedy."
The Brothers Karamazov,67,0,"Outside, Kolya and Alyosha get to know each other. At first Kolya tries to impress Alyosha with his knowledge – disparaging religion and championing socialism, among other things. Frustrated, he asks Alyosha if he despises him, a question that surprises Alyosha. Alyosha quickly reassures Kolya."
The Brothers Karamazov,67,1,"Kolya is won over by his frankness and lack of condescension. He opens up to Alyosha and confesses that he knows he suffers from vanity. Alyosha tells Kolya that he shouldn't be so worried about appearing ridiculous, and they both declare their friendship."
The Brothers Karamazov,67,2,Their conversation is cut short when the famous doctor emerges from the room.
The Brothers Karamazov,66,0,"Ilyusha's room is crowded with kids, along with the rest of his family. Captain Snegiryov has accepted Katerina's charity, and she has even paid for a famous doctor to come in to diagnose Ilyusha that day. Alyosha is also present."
The Brothers Karamazov,66,1,"When Kolya comes in, Ilyusha is thrilled. He's petting a mastiff puppy that his father brought him, but he's still in mourning over Zhuchka. Kolya tells Ilyusha that he's brought him an even better dog."
The Brothers Karamazov,66,2,"But when the dog, Perezvon, finally enters, Ilyusha instantly recognizes it as the ever-suffering Zhuchka."
The Brothers Karamazov,66,3,"It seems that over the past several weeks, Kolya has found Zhuchka and trained it all kinds of tricks."
The Brothers Karamazov,66,4,"Thrilled by Ilyusha's reaction, Kolya brings out his toy cannon again but hands it over to Ilyusha's mother to play with at Ilyusha's request."
The Brothers Karamazov,66,5,"Kolya entertains Ilyusha with the story of his recent brush with the law. Walking through the square, he had tricked a peasant into rolling over a goose with a cart. He was taken to court but got off with just a stern lecture."
The Brothers Karamazov,66,6,"Another child, Kartashov, tries to show up Kolya on his knowledge of history – specifically the founders of Troy – but Kolya is able to silence the child with a few clever questions."
The Brothers Karamazov,66,7,"The antics are drawn to a close, however, when the famous doctor makes his appearance in the room. Everybody else clears out."
The Brothers Karamazov,82,0,"Alyosha then takes the stand, and the prosecutor grills him about his brother's state of mind. Alyosha strongly insists on his belief in Dmitri's innocence and points to Smerdyakov as the real murderer. When the prosecutor asks for proof, Alyosha can only say that he can tell by the look on his brother's face that he's innocent."
The Brothers Karamazov,82,1,"As Fetyukovich questions Alyosha, Alyosha suddenly remembers Dmitri's unusual gesture of pointing to his chest well above his heart in a conversation they had on their last meeting before their father's murder. Alyosha realizes that Dmitri must have been pointing to the amulet with the 1,500 roubles – an important memory that might support Dmitri's contention that he had had 1,500 roubles all along."
The Brothers Karamazov,82,2,"Next up is Katerina. She explains that she understood Dmitri needed money when she entrusted him with the 3,000 roubles and that she viewed this as a kind of indirect loan. Then, much to Dmitri's dismay, she tells the entire court about the time when she went to borrow money from Dmitri to save her father's honor."
The Brothers Karamazov,82,3,"After Katerina comes Grushenka, who, in the course of her testimony, reveals that Rakitin is her cousin. This destroys Rakitin's credibility – another score for the defense."
The Brothers Karamazov,82,4,Finally Ivan is called to the stand.
The Brothers Karamazov,83,0,"The narrator tells us that Ivan was originally supposed to testify before Alyosha, but his testimony was delayed because of his illness. Ivan doesn't seem much better now as he walks to the stand, and for some reason, Alyosha jumps up at this point and says, ""Aaah, I remember it."" No one notices Alyosha."
The Brothers Karamazov,83,1,"Ivan answers a couple of questions vaguely, and the judge says that it's OK for him to go home if he's sick. He steps off the stand, then returns. Suddenly he pulls out a wad of bills and announces that Smerdyakov is the murderer."
The Brothers Karamazov,83,2,Katerina interrupts his testimony and tells everyone to ignore him. But Ivan keeps raving and has to be hauled away by the marshal.
The Brothers Karamazov,83,3,"Hysterical, Katerina rushes to the stand and waves around the incriminating letter Dmitri had written her. Like Ivan, she seems to be on the brink of a nervous breakdown as she furiously explains the story behind the document. She is whisked away to be attended by the famous doctor from Moscow, who's also treating Ivan."
The Brothers Karamazov,83,4,"Grushenka denounces Katerina's actions and has to be taken out of the courtroom as well. Dmitri has to be restrained, and his defense lawyer isn't too thrilled about the new evidence."
The Brothers Karamazov,83,5,"At 8 o'clock in the evening, Kirillovich begins the closing statement for the prosecution."
The Brothers Karamazov,10,0,"When Dmitri enters, he gives a deep bow to Zosima and receives his blessing. Then he bows deeply to his father, who bows in such a way that even though he looks serious, he still looks like he's mocking Dmitri."
The Brothers Karamazov,10,1,"Miusov can't let Ivan's argument in the previous chapter go. He tells the group that Ivan had also claimed that man only loves mankind because of a belief in immortality; a love for mankind is not something that comes naturally or is part of human nature. If you're an atheist and don't believe in immortality, then love for mankind is just hypocrisy: you should embrace egotism and do whatever you want. Ivan's point can be summed up in the phrase ""everything is permitted."""
The Brothers Karamazov,10,2,Zosima remarks that these contradictions in Ivan's beliefs only indicate that Ivan is continuing to wrestle with these spiritual issues. He gives Ivan a blessing.
The Brothers Karamazov,10,3,"This solemn moment is broken up by, you guessed it, Fyodor, who immediately jumps up and accuses Dmitri of trying to bilk him out of his money. He also tells Zosima that Dmitri has been cavorting with another woman even though he's already engaged to the daughter of his former colonel."
The Brothers Karamazov,10,4,"Dmitri starts yelling back at his father, then the monks start exclaiming at the scandalous behavior of the two."
The Brothers Karamazov,10,5,"Suddenly Zosima gets up and kneels before Dmitri, bows, and touches the floor with his forehead. He then asks everyone in the cell to forgive him."
The Brothers Karamazov,10,6,"Overwhelmed, Dmitri rushes out of the room. Miusov attempts to excuse himself, but Fyodor says he's leaving. Miusov decides to stay and heads toward the Father Superior's with Ivan to have dinner."
The Brothers Karamazov,11,0,"After the guests leave, Alyosha accompanies the feeble Zosima to his cell. There, Zosima tells Alyosha that he will have to leave the monastery and endure life out in the real world before he returns to the monastery. Zosima tells Alyosha to ""seek happiness in sorrow"" and then to leave his cell to join his brothers."
The Brothers Karamazov,11,1,"Outside Alyosha encounters Rakitin, another novice. Rakitin is a cynical type, and interprets Zosima's bow to Dmitri as a fake prediction of a crime that's about to be committed in the Karamazov family. Alyosha is shocked, but Rakitin thinks it's obvious that the Karamazovs are all headed toward some awful deed."
The Brothers Karamazov,11,2,"According to Rakitin, Dmitri will do anything for Grushenka, the woman he's having an affair with. But Fyodor also has the hots for Grushenka. Meanwhile, Ivan is circling over Katerina, Dmitri's wealthy and dignified fiancée."
The Brothers Karamazov,11,3,"Rakitin has the inside scoop because he's Grushenka's confidante, but Alyosha suggests that Rakitin is also in love with Katerina."
The Brothers Karamazov,11,4,"Just then, Rakitin points out that Fyodor is running out of the Father Superior's quarters, followed by Ivan, Miusov, and the landowner Maximov. Fyodor and Father Isidore are shouting at each other."
The Brothers Karamazov,8,0,"In contrast to the women Zosima greeted in the previous chapter, the next visitor is a wealthy landowner. She thanks Zosima for healing her daughter Lise, or rather, for improving Lise's condition – she seems to be partially paralyzed from the waist down."
The Brothers Karamazov,8,1,"Lise laughs outright at Alyosha, who seems embarrassed by her attention."
The Brothers Karamazov,8,2,"It turns out the lady landowner and Lise already know Alyosha. Lise has a message for him from Katerina Ivanovna, who wants to talk to Alyosha about Dmitri."
The Brothers Karamazov,8,3,"The lady landowner voices her concern to Zosima that she feels unable to love mankind. Zosima praises her for feeling troubled and asks her to keep working at it. But the most important piece of advice he gives her is to avoid lying, in particular lying to herself."
The Brothers Karamazov,8,4,"Lise continues to mock Alyosha, and Zosima asks her why she's giving Alyosha such a hard time. Lise tells Zosima that Alyosha used to visit them often but no longer does. Zosima promises to send Alyosha to visit them."
The Brothers Karamazov,9,0,"When Zosima returns to his cell, Fyodor is relishing his attacks on Miusov, who flatters himself as an intellectual in the enlightened, European style (meaning not religious)."
The Brothers Karamazov,9,1,"The conversation turns to Ivan's recent editorial on the ecclesiastical courts, the one that caused such a scandal before he left Moscow to return to his father's home. Ivan argues that the ecclesiastical courts (or the Russian Orthodox Church) should take over the state courts because only they can reform criminals by providing them with a moral guide, something the state courts can't do."
The Brothers Karamazov,9,2,"Miusov, who at first considers Ivan an intellectual like himself, agrees with Ivan's argument at this point because he thinks it's almost socialistic: that is, the state disappears as Russia moves toward a utopian society."
The Brothers Karamazov,9,3,"But Ivan explains that the state disappears only to be replaced by the Church. (Imagine what it would be like if the United States were governed by a single religious group, rather than a government. Imagine having a church determine your taxes, administer the prisons and the courts, run the DMV, etc. That's essentially what Ivan is proposing.)"
The Brothers Karamazov,9,4,"Miusov vehemently disagrees with this religious turn in Ivan's argument and accuses him of ""Ultramontanism."" But Father Paissy is in wholehearted agreement."
The Brothers Karamazov,9,5,"Just then, Dmitri arrives."
The Brothers Karamazov,59,0,"Dmitri confesses his terrible secret, which is that the money is actually the money he stole from Katerina. (This makes sense if you've been keeping track of the fact that none of the characters can ever specifically state how much money Dmitri throws around.)"
The Brothers Karamazov,59,1,"On his first spree with Grushenka a month ago, he had only spent 1,500 roubles, not 3,000, as legend had it. He had saved the other half of the money, sewn up in a bit of cloth and hung like an ""amulet"" around his neck before he had left for Mokroye, thinking he might need money to marry Grushenka if she accepted him."
The Brothers Karamazov,59,2,"The prosecutor and the district attorney are skeptical. They ask him where the cloth is, and Dmitri doesn't know exactly – he just remembers tearing it up in the town square. They ask him where he got the cloth, and he guesses that he might have stolen his landlady's bonnet."
The Brothers Karamazov,59,3,"By this point, Dmitri realizes that he is lost. After a short break, they decide to proceed to interrogate the witnesses."
The Brothers Karamazov,58,0,"The prosecutor and the deputy commissioner search Dmitri's clothes, thinking he might have sewn his money into them, but find nothing. They discover some blood on his right cuff and take all the clothes in as evidence. They find some clothes from Kalganov for Dmitri to borrow."
The Brothers Karamazov,58,1,"The prosecutor informs Dmitri that Grigory's testimony conflicts with his story. Dmitri had said that the gate to the garden was closed, while Grigory insisted it was open. Puzzled, Dmitri is shown the envelope that had the money, and his exclamations only serve as further proof to his interrogators that he's guilty."
The Brothers Karamazov,58,2,"Frustrated, and now convinced that it must have been Smerdyakov who killed his father, Dmitri decides to confess an awful secret."
The Brothers Karamazov,24,0,"Early the next morning, Alyosha is awakened by the elder Zosima. Although Zosima is quite frail, he's eager to speak to the monks who have gathered around him. He speaks in fragments that are scarcely coherent, but his general message seems to be that the monks should seek to love all mankind, they bear the guilt of all mankind, and it is only through love that they can fulfill their religious duty."
The Brothers Karamazov,24,1,"The whole monastery is in a general state of excitement, although the monks scarcely dare to admit to themselves their hope that on his death, Zosima will perform extraordinary miracles."
The Brothers Karamazov,24,2,"Their hopes are fueled when they learn that the woman Zosima had admonished for praying for her son as if he were dead (in Book 2, Chapter 3) has actually received a letter from her son announcing that he is returning home soon. Alyosha learns of this news through a letter from Madame Khokhlakov, sent to him through Rakitin, and everyone else somehow learns of it too."
The Brothers Karamazov,24,3,"A visiting monk from Obdorsk (who also happened to be there when Zosima had made the prediction about the old woman and her son) is confused by these events. The night before, he had visited Father Ferapont, Zosima's primary rival at the monastery. Unlike Zosima, Ferapont is, well, a grouch. Generally curt because of his vow of silence, Ferapont fasts a lot and hangs out alone having visions beyond the monastery's beehives. When he does speak, Ferapont is generally rude or just confused."
The Brothers Karamazov,24,4,"To the Obdorsk monk, Ferapont talks about his visions, including one where the Holy Spirit announced that someone would visit him today to ask him stupid questions – hint hint."
The Brothers Karamazov,24,5,"Meanwhile, back in Zosima's cell, he is ready for bed, and only a few monks and Alyosha remain with him. Zosima reminds Alyosha of his obligations out in the world, to his family. While Alyosha leaves reluctantly, he is heartened by Zosima's promise to entrust him with his last words."
The Brothers Karamazov,24,6,"Before Alyosha leaves, Father Paissy pulls him aside to remind him that science has yet to come up with a superior vision of humanity than Christianity. As he leaves, Alyosha realizes that Father Paissy has probably been entrusted with his spiritual well-being once Zosima has passed away, and he's grateful for his spiritual guidance."
The Brothers Karamazov,25,0,"After leaving the monastery that morning, Alyosha heads straight to his father's, who's in a grumpy mood."
The Brothers Karamazov,25,1,Fyodor goes off on a tirade about how everyone is evil; it's just that he lives his evil openly. Fyodor then explains to Alyosha that the reason that he won't press charges against Dmitri is because he knows that would make Dmitri sympathetic in Grushenka's eyes.
The Brothers Karamazov,25,2,"Fyodor then remarks that Ivan's a cold fish who loves no one. He asks Alyosha to ask Dmitri if Dmitri would leave Grushenka alone for one or two thousand rubles. Alyosha hesitatingly agrees, but Fyodor quickly takes the offer back spitefully."
The Brothers Karamazov,25,3,"Alyosha gets up to leave and kisses his father goodbye. Fyodor is surprised by the gesture and wonders if he'll see Alyosha again, but Alyosha reassures him that it's just a simple goodbye. After Alyosha leaves, Fyodor goes to his bedroom to sleep."
The Brothers Karamazov,53,0,"The novel picks up with Perkhotin knocking at the widow Morozov's house, where Grushenka is renting a place. Here the servant Fenya tells Perkhotin that Dmitri had arrived earlier, covered in blood, and had even confessed to killing a man."
The Brothers Karamazov,53,1,"More concerned than ever, Perkhotin starts to go to Fyodor Karamazov's but decides against it because he fears causing a scandal just in case Fyodor Karamazov was not murdered. Instead, he decides to ask Madame Khokhlakov what happened."
The Brothers Karamazov,53,2,Although it's late – 11 at night – Madame Khokhlakov is finally roused from her bed to receive Perkhotin. She attests that she never lent Dmitri any money and even writes a short statement to that effect.
The Brothers Karamazov,53,3,"Perkhotin and Khokhlakov experience a mutual attraction, despite the extraordinary circumstances, and Perkhotin goes on his way."
The Brothers Karamazov,52,0,"The party begins, with the champagne flowing and scrumptious morsels for everyone. The peasant girls dance and sing, somewhat bawdily. Grushenka watches everything from an armchair, pulling Dmitri over to whisper to him from time to time."
The Brothers Karamazov,52,1,"Dmitri goes out on the verandah to get some fresh air. He encounters the innkeeper, who seems to be worried about something."
The Brothers Karamazov,52,2,"Dmitri goes back to the party but Grushenka isn't there. He finds her in another room, weeping in a corner. She declares her love for him, and Dmitri is ecstatic."
The Brothers Karamazov,52,3,"They return to the party and even get the Poles out of their room to join the fun. The Poles, however, aren't amused by Dmitri. Grushenka is suddenly exhausted, and Dmitri takes her back behind the curtain dividing the room."
The Brothers Karamazov,52,4,"Drunk, exhausted, and overjoyed, Grushenka and Dmitri dream of their new life together. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by the arrival of the police commissioner, the deputy commissioner, the deputy prosecutor, and the district attorney."
The Brothers Karamazov,52,5,The attorney declares that they are arresting Dmitri for the murder of his father. Dmitri is utterly bewildered.
The Brothers Karamazov,2,0,"Now we get to wife #2. The next lovely lady Fyodor decided to take for a wife was Sofia Ivanovna, an orphan and the ward of General Vorokhov's widow. This widow was apparently was so hard on Sofia that she was once caught trying to hang herself."
The Brothers Karamazov,2,1,"Fyodor swooped in and eloped with Sofia, but he was enraged to discover that she wouldn't be getting any dowry."
The Brothers Karamazov,2,2,"This second marriage was just as terrible as the first, or perhaps more so, with Fyodor having orgies in the house in front of his wife. Sofia became a ""shrieker,"" which is the local term for a hysteric."
The Brothers Karamazov,2,3,"Sofia bore Fyodor two sons, Ivan and Alexei, and died soon afterward. Upon her death, the general's widow visited Fyodor, slapped his face, and took the children into her care. When she died, the kids went to stay with her heir, Yefim Petrovich Polenov, who actually took good care of them and made sure they got an education."
The Brothers Karamazov,2,4,Ivan seemed to be particularly gifted intellectually and went off to Moscow to study. He paid his own way by writing journalism and reviews. One editorial on the issue of ecclesiastical courts caused quite a controversy.
The Brothers Karamazov,2,5,"Everyone was surprised when Ivan showed up back in town at Fyodor's, on the invitation of Dmitri as it turned out. The precise reasons why, however, the narrator isn't going to tell us until later (again, wait a few hundred pages...)."
The Brothers Karamazov,2,6,"But it turns out that Alexei has been in town staying at the local monastery for at least a year before Ivan shows up, which is the narrator's way of shifting gears into the next chapter."
The Brothers Karamazov,3,0,"At this point, we've caught up to the time period of the main events of the story. Alyosha (a nickname for Alexei) is now 20, Ivan is 24, and Dmitri is 28. Of all the sons, Alyosha is least like Fyodor. He's pure, sweet, and everyone spontaneously loves him."
The Brothers Karamazov,3,1,"Alyosha had initially come to town to visit his mother's grave. Just three years before, his father had gone off to Odessa and made a pile of cash. Upon his return to town, he devoted all his time to acting like a fool and humiliating women and generally creating scandal."
The Brothers Karamazov,3,2,"Fyodor didn't even remember where Alyosha's mother was buried – Grigory the servant had to show Alyosha the grave marker. After seeing his mother's grave, Alyosha asked his father's consent to enter the monastery, and after cracking a few blasphemous jokes, his father consented."
The Brothers Karamazov,88,0,"Like Chapters 6-9, Chapters 10-13 consist entirely in the defense attorney's speech, with little action, if any. We give you the basic rundown of the speech over the next four chapters."
The Brothers Karamazov,88,1,"In contrast to the prosecutor, Fetyukovich is quite calm, and everyone in the courtroom is impressed with his eloquence."
The Brothers Karamazov,88,2,"Fetyukovich puts forward his argument that while all of the details the prosecutor presented seem convincing when taken as a whole, not one of the details can be held up as a concrete, indisputable fact. Every detail can be questioned or challenged in some way."
The Brothers Karamazov,88,3,"Fetyukovich describes the prosecutor's use of psychology as a ""stick with two ends"": psychology can justify two contradictory explanations of the same thing. So on one hand the prosecutor says Dmitri recklessly left an envelope on his father's bedroom floor in his mad rush. On the other hand, he says Dmitri was methodical in making sure that Grigory was dead. Psychology paints Dmitri as both reckless and methodical at the same time. How can that be, Fetyukovich asks?"
The Brothers Karamazov,88,4,"Fetyukovich gets a few chuckles from the courtroom here, then he moves on."
The Brothers Karamazov,89,0,"Fetyukovich next tackles the question of the money. To put it bluntly, where is it? No one, Fetyukovich points out, can confirm actually having seen Fyodor Karamazov put the money in the so-called envelope. If the money never existed, then Dmitri couldn't have stolen it. Fetyukovich dismisses Kirillovich's conjecture that Dmitri hid it in some secret crevice in the inn as pure fantasy."
The Brothers Karamazov,89,1,"Fetyukovich then explains Katerina's conflicting testimony as the impulsive utterances of a vengeful woman. This is kind of clever, because if someone as well-respected as Katerina can be both lofty and petty at the same time, Dmitri, too, can have contradictory impulses toward both honor and utter disgracefulness."
The Brothers Karamazov,89,2,"On the question of Katerina's letter, Fetyukovich points out how closely Dmitri's words about the envelope echo the way that Smerdyakov talks about the letter, suggesting that Dmitri, like everyone else, only knew about the money secondhand, from Smerdyakov."
The Brothers Karamazov,70,0,"When Alyosha arrives at Madame Khokhlakov's at Lise's urgent request, Madame Khokhlakov is a nervous wreck. She's been immobilized by swollen foot for the past three weeks, but that hasn't stopped her from getting all dressed up."
The Brothers Karamazov,70,1,"Madame Khokhlakov's latest tizzy is over an anonymous article that's appeared in a newspaper called Rumors, which sounds a bit like a 19th-century version of PeopleUS Weekly."
The Brothers Karamazov,70,2,or
The Brothers Karamazov,70,3,"Someone has written horrible things about events in their town – which the narrator finally names as Skotoprigonyevsk. (Try saying that 5 times fast.) This anonymous author has claimed that Dmitri has flirted with a certain unnamed society lady – i.e., Madame Khokhlakov – who has gone so far as to offer him 3,000 roubles two hours before the murder to run away with her. He spurned her, however, and it is implied that he preferred to kill his father rather than spend his life in Siberia with this unnamed society lady."
The Brothers Karamazov,70,4,"Madame Khokhlakov is convinced that it's about her, and that it's by Rakitin. Rakitin is jealous because she rejected him and is pursuing a flirtation with Perkhotin, the young official to whom Dmitri pawned his pistols. Rakitin had written a silly little poem about her foot, and she and Perkhotin had laughed over it."
The Brothers Karamazov,70,5,"Madame Khokhlakov also informs Alyosha, to his surprise, that Ivan has visited Lise. After Ivan's visit, Lise has been terribly upset."
The Brothers Karamazov,70,6,"Their conversation is interrupted when Perkhotin enters, and Alyosha leaves for Lise's room."
The Brothers Karamazov,71,0,"When Alyosha arrives, Lise is also a nervous wreck. She tells him that she craves ""disorder,"" that she wants to suffer. She also tells him that Kalganov has even proposed to her."
The Brothers Karamazov,71,1,Lise tells him that she has horrible dreams involving tiny devils infesting her closets. Alyosha admits that he has had the same dream. (Whoa.)
The Brothers Karamazov,71,2,She also dreams that a – prepare yourself for ugly anti-Semitism here – Jew is torturing a small child while she eats pineapple compote.
The Brothers Karamazov,71,3,Alyosha is surprised to learn that Lise actually invited Ivan and talked to him about her dream. Ivan had laughed at her and left.
The Brothers Karamazov,71,4,"Lise passes Alyosha a note to give to Ivan. When he leaves, she slams the door on her own finger."
The Brothers Karamazov,39,0,"Zosima begins by telling everyone about his older brother, Markel, who died from consumption when he was only 17. All through his life, Markel had rebelled against any religious teaching. But at the age of 17, during Holy Week, his consumption took a turn for the worse, and the doctor said he had a very short time left to live."
The Brothers Karamazov,39,1,Suddenly Markel underwent some kind of religious conversion. Zosima recalls his brother's joyful expression as he celebrated God's glory and exhorted everyone around him to welcome paradise on earth. His brother passed away a few weeks after Easter.
The Brothers Karamazov,39,2,"Zosima then recalls the first time he felt God's word in his soul. When he was 8 years old, he heard the story of Job in church, and he felt overwhelmed with awe and astonishment. He tells his fellow monks that all they have to do to touch the souls of their flock is to share the moving stories of Scripture."
The Brothers Karamazov,39,3,"As an example, he relates the story of a young man he encountered in his early days as a monk. The young man wonders whether even animals ""have Christ."" Zosima tells the young man a story about how a saint once convinced a bear not to attack him by handing it a piece of bread. The young man is moved by the story."
The Brothers Karamazov,39,4,"Flash forward to an older Zosima, who's now a hip cadet officer partying in St. Petersburg. He falls in love with a girl who's smart and hot, but then he gets called away for a couple months on a military mission. When he gets back, the girl is married. Hurt and angry, Zosima deliberately insults the girl's husband during a conversation about an important event. This insult leads to a duel."
The Brothers Karamazov,39,5,"(He parenthetically remarks that it's 1826, so they might be arguing about the Decembrist uprising, when a radical group tried to overthrow the Tsar.)"
The Brothers Karamazov,39,6,"The evening before the duel, Zosima is in a foul mood. He takes it out on his servant Afanasy by slapping him so hard that he bleeds."
The Brothers Karamazov,39,7,"The next morning, though, Zosima's mood is radically different. He's filled with a deep self-consciousness that there is something utterly shameful within him. He realizes that he treated Afanasy with inhuman cruelty. He realizes that Afanasy is a man created in God's image like himself, just like the guy he's going to duel. In fact, everyone is made in God's image."
The Brothers Karamazov,39,8,"Filled with this enlightenment, Zosima rides off to the duel with his second (in a duel, each man picks a second to help ensure the duel is fair), a fellow military officer. Zosima and the girl's husband take twelve paces apart from each other, and the girl's husband takes the first shot. Instead of shooting back, Zosima throws away his weapon and apologizes."
The Brothers Karamazov,39,9,"Everyone's in dismay. Zosima explains that if he hadn't let the girl's husband take a shot at him, everyone would have thought he was apologizing because he was a coward. No one knows what to do with that, but they all acknowledge that he's done something ""original."""
The Brothers Karamazov,39,10,"Back at his regiment, the officers debate whether Zosima ought to resign, but Zosima interrupts them to announce that he's resigning and joining a monastery."
The Brothers Karamazov,39,11,"When news of his actions spreads through the town, Zosima is greeted with laughter, but not with malice, as everyone seems to accept him with love. At a social gathering, the girl he was in love with embraces him with gratitude, as does her husband and everyone else."
The Brothers Karamazov,39,12,"Just then, Zosima notices an elderly man approaching him."
The Brothers Karamazov,39,13,"This elderly man, an important and wealthy official well respected in the town, had never spoken to Zosima before. But after the dueling incident, the elderly man begins to visit him regularly in his rooms, where they have long philosophical discussions."
The Brothers Karamazov,39,14,"Zosima is impressed with his visitor's wisdom, and much of what he says echoes Zosima's later, more mature philosophy, including the idea that paradise is possible on earth if universal brotherhood can be achieved (a huge ""if,"" given all the havoc the Karamazov brothers create)."
The Brothers Karamazov,39,15,"Eventually Zosima's visitor confesses that he killed someone. Fourteen years ago he was in love with a widow who had already promised herself to an officer. Although the officer was away on a military campaign, the widow expected him to return to her soon."
The Brothers Karamazov,39,16,"Furious, the visitor snuck in at night and stabbed her to death. He then stole a few items to make it look as if a servant had robbed and murdered her."
The Brothers Karamazov,39,17,"The visitor's plan succeeded. A disgruntled servant was blamed for the deed and – conveniently, before the visitor could feel guilty about letting someone else take the fall for his crime – the servant died a couple weeks later of some illness."
The Brothers Karamazov,39,18,"As the years went by, the visitor was tormented by guilt. He fell in love again, married a young woman, and had three children, but he couldn't bear to embrace them because of his guilt."
The Brothers Karamazov,39,19,"Zosima advises the visitor to confess his deeds, but the visitor continues to waffle for a couple of weeks. The visitor leaves late one night, then suddenly returns. They sit together, and the visitor mysteriously tells Zosima to remember that he had returned that night."
The Brothers Karamazov,39,20,"The next day, the visitor confesses everything. Nobody really believes him, even though he kept some souvenirs from the widow he murdered, and many think he's crazy. As if on cue, the visitor falls seriously ill. On his deathbed, he confesses to Zosima that he had returned that night to kill Zosima for fear that Zosima would tell everyone about his terrible secret."
The Brothers Karamazov,39,21,"The town blames Zosima for the visitor's mad confession and subsequent decline. When the visitor dies a couple of weeks later, Zosima leaves town and joins a monastery. It's only at the end of this section that we finally learn the name of the visitor, Mikhail."
The Brothers Karamazov,38,0,"When Alyosha arrives at the elder Zosima's quarters, he is sitting up looking relatively well, surrounded by four other monks: Father Iosif, Father Paissy, Father Mikhail (the superior), and Brother Anfim."
The Brothers Karamazov,38,1,"Zosima asks Alyosha if he has seen his brother, but Alyosha isn't sure which brother he is referring to at first. Zosima explains that he had seen a fate of terrible suffering in the face of his brother Dmitri and had hoped that Alyosha could save him. He tells Alyosha to find Dmitri at all costs after their conversation."
The Brothers Karamazov,38,2,Zosima then says how much Alyosha reminds him of his own dead brother.
The Brothers Karamazov,38,3,"The narrator intervenes at this point to tell the reader that what follows in the next chapter is a narrative of Zosima's life written by Alyosha, who wrote down what he remembered of that night much later."
The Brothers Karamazov,95,0,"The funeral is Ilyusha's. That's right, that angelic little boy from Book 10 died just a couple days after Dmitri was sentenced."
The Brothers Karamazov,95,1,"All the boys have collected around Ilyusha's coffin, including Kolya."
The Brothers Karamazov,95,2,The narrator notes that Ilyusha's corpse doesn't smell. His body is covered in flowers donated by Lise Khokhlakov and Katerina Ivanovna.
The Brothers Karamazov,95,3,"Captain Snegiryov is sober but still a mess. Mrs. Snegiryov and Ninochka are also at the coffin. Mrs. Snegiryov wants a white rose that has been placed in Ilyusha's hands, but the captain refuses to give it to her."
The Brothers Karamazov,95,4,"The boys and Alyosha carry Ilyusha's coffin out a few hundred paces away to the church, accompanied by Snegiryov, who fusses over trivial details such as a crust of bread he had promised to crumble over his son's grave so that the swallows would visit it."
The Brothers Karamazov,95,5,"The coffin is placed in the middle of the church, and everyone surrounds it as the funeral service is read. The coffin is then buried, and the children have to withhold Snegiryov from the open grave."
The Brothers Karamazov,95,6,"On the way back, Snegiryov starts for the grave again and the children have to persuade him to follow them home."
The Brothers Karamazov,95,7,"When they return Snegiryov gives his wife some flowers from the funeral, then breaks down in tears, as does the rest of the family, over the sight of his son's boots."
The Brothers Karamazov,95,8,"Unable to bear it, Kolya suddenly leaves, along with the rest of the children and Alyosha. As they walk slowly down the path, they come upon Ilyusha's favorite stone."
The Brothers Karamazov,95,9,"Overcome with emotion, Alyosha makes a little speech to the children about how he would like them to remember this moment as a time when they were all good and kind. The children declare their love for Alyosha."
The Brothers Karamazov,95,10,"Kolya asks Alyosha about the afterlife, and Alyosha affirms that there is an afterlife where they will see Ilyusha again."
The Brothers Karamazov,95,11,"Then they go back to the Snegiryovs' to eat pancakes. Really. (Hey, it's a Russian funeral tradition, OK?) The boys all cheer for Karamazov."
The Brothers Karamazov,94,0,"Alyosha then heads straight to the hospital, where Dmitri, who had come down with a fever after the trial, is being kept in a special area."
The Brothers Karamazov,94,1,"Alyosha tells Dmitri not to feel bad about trying to escape – after all, he is innocent. He admonishes Dmitri just to remember his promise to reform his ways and become a new man."
The Brothers Karamazov,94,2,"Dmitri tells Alyosha about his plans to escape with Grushenka to America, learn English, and return to Russia disguised as an American."
The Brothers Karamazov,94,3,"Suddenly Katerina appears in the doorway. She rushes to Dmitri and clasps his hands, and they seem to come to a reconciliation over everything that's happened between them. Although they are both involved with other people now, they promise to love each other forever. Katerina also affirms that she too believes in Dmitri's innocence; she only revealed his letter at the trial out of petty jealousy."
The Brothers Karamazov,94,4,"As Katerina leaves, she encounters Grushenka and asks her forgiveness, which Grushenka will give only if Katerina pulls off Dmitri's escape."
The Brothers Karamazov,94,5,"Alyosha follows Katerina out the door, then heads over to a funeral."
The Brothers Karamazov,33,0,"Ivan tells Alyosha that it's about time they got acquainted, since they haven't really gotten to know each other since Ivan left for school when he was 15 and Alyosha 11."
The Brothers Karamazov,33,1,"Thinking about his dramatic scene with Katerina, Ivan tells Alyosha that he still thirsts for life, which he believes is a very Karamazov quality. Alyosha agrees and professes that we should all love life, even more than meaning."
The Brothers Karamazov,33,2,"Ivan asks Alyosha whether he's seen Dmitri today. Alyosha says no, but he did see Smerdyakov. Ivan is intensely interested in what Smerdyakov had to say. Alyosha asks Ivan what will happen between Dmitri and their father, and Ivan fends off the question, asking Alyosha if he's Dmitri's ""keeper"" (which is oddly exactly what Smerdyakov said in the previous chapter)."
The Brothers Karamazov,33,3,"Despite everything, Ivan seems to be in a celebratory mood and is positively happy about being free of Katerina. In fact, he wonders if he ever loved her in the first place."
The Brothers Karamazov,33,4,"He then claims that it's important for Alyosha to understand exactly what kind of man he is, and goes off on a long monologue about how he believes in God but rejects the world that God created."
The Brothers Karamazov,32,0,"Alyosha decides he'll try to catch Dmitri at the gazebo by his father's house again, so he plants himself there in the hope that Dmitri will show up eventually."
The Brothers Karamazov,32,1,"He's surprised to hear the sound of guitar playing and a man's voice singing. A woman replies, and Alyosha realizes it's Smerdyakov playing the guitar to one of the neighbor girls, Maria Kondatrievna."
The Brothers Karamazov,32,2,"All of a sudden, Alyosha sneezes. He can't eavesdrop on the two any longer, so he goes up to them and inquires after Dmitri. Smerdyakov tells Alyosha that he isn't Dmitri's ""keeper,"" that Dmitri is constantly threatening him. Maria adds that the other day she heard Dmitri telling Smerdyakov that he would grind his head in a mortar."
The Brothers Karamazov,32,3,"Smerdyakov tells Alyosha that Dmitri was invited to meet up with Ivan at a local tavern, so Alyosha takes leave of them and heads to the tavern."
The Brothers Karamazov,32,4,"When Alyosha arrives at the tavern, Ivan invites him up to his private room, where he's dining alone."
The Brothers Karamazov,44,0,"Alyosha gets back to the monastery at 9 in the evening and visits Zosima's cell, where Father Paissy continues to read from the Gospels over Zosima's coffin. Alyosha kneels to pray and finds that instead of all of those conflicting emotions he felt earlier, he just feels a kind of ""sweetness."""
The Brothers Karamazov,44,1,"Father Paissy is reading the story of the marriage at Cana, where Jesus performed his first miracle of transforming water into wine."
The Brothers Karamazov,44,2,"As Alyosha drifts in and out of sleep, still praying, he enters into a kind of a trance, in which snippets of Paissy's reading mingle with his own scattered impressions of the day's events."
The Brothers Karamazov,44,3,"While in this trance-like state, he sees Zosima himself appear before him, filled with joy. Zosima tells Alyosha that everyone – presumably in heaven – is at the wedding feast, everyone who gave just an onion."
The Brothers Karamazov,44,4,"Suddenly Alyosha is filled with rapture and wakes up. He goes outside and falls to ground, kissing it."
The Brothers Karamazov,44,5,"Three days later, Alyosha leaves the monastery as Zosima had directed him."
The Brothers Karamazov,45,0,"Meanwhile the novel finally returns to Dmitri. So what's he been up to for the past 200 pages – which take up only two days, by the way, as the narrator reminds us on the first page of this chapter?"
The Brothers Karamazov,45,1,"Dmitri has been making a royal fool of himself, that's what."
The Brothers Karamazov,45,2,"Ashamed of stealing 3,000 roubles from Katerina only to spend it all on Grushenka, Dmitri decides he must return the money to Katerina somehow to save his honor. Only then can he begin a new life with Grushenka."
The Brothers Karamazov,45,3,"But Dmitri has no money. So he hatches up the desperate plan of going to see Samsonov, Grushenka's old ""patron,"" to borrow the money to repay Katerina and to whisk away Grushenka."
The Brothers Karamazov,45,4,"Dmitri arrives at Samsonov's and is taken upstairs to see the old man himself, holed up in a small bedroom with his swollen legs. In Dmitri's confusion, he notices a malicious glint in Samsonov's eyes, but he quickly brushes this aside as the peevish wincing of an old man in constant pain from his gouty leg."
The Brothers Karamazov,45,5,"Dmitri proposes that Samsonov lend him money, using his inheritance, a woodlot in Chermashnya, as collateral. Of course Dmitri doesn't yet have his inheritance, nor is it likely he will ever receive it because it's being held by his father."
The Brothers Karamazov,45,6,"Samsonov rejects Dmitri's proposal, but then suggests that Dmitri see a fellow by the name of Lyagavy, who's been trying to purchase the woodlot from his father. Lyagavy is staying with a priest in the village of Ilyinskoye."
The Brothers Karamazov,45,7,"Dmitri is effusively thankful for the tip and leaves Samsonov. The narrator tells us that it was all a malicious joke on Samsonov's part, and that he was infuriated by Dmitri's visit."
The Brothers Karamazov,77,0,Poof! The devil!
The Brothers Karamazov,77,1,"Well, not with the horns and pitchfork and flames and all that."
The Brothers Karamazov,77,2,"Ivan's Satan appears in the manner of a mild-mannered, impoverished, elderly gentleman sitting amiably on his sofa."
The Brothers Karamazov,77,3,"Ivan sternly tells the nice old man that he's just a figment of everything that's base and, above all, stupid in his imagination, but the devil insists on his reality."
The Brothers Karamazov,77,4,"The devil reminds him that he had gone to see Smerdyakov to find out what he had told Katerina, which he still doesn't know. But Ivan tells the devil that this is no proof of the devil's existence: the devil only remembers this point because Ivan was about to."
The Brothers Karamazov,77,5,Ivan then decides to wet a towel and place it on his head. Of course – wouldn't you if you were sitting across from the devil?
The Brothers Karamazov,77,6,"The devil then reminds Ivan that he had once accused Alyosha of spying on their conversations (of which they seem to have had several). Ivan admits that this was a momentary lapse, but insists that the devil is still a hallucination."
The Brothers Karamazov,77,7,"The devil goes on to tell some silly stories about himself and his adventures incarnated on earth. He wants nothing more than to be a simple ""fat, 250-pound merchant's wife"" and light candles to God, but instead he ends up with rheumatism."
The Brothers Karamazov,77,8,Ivan decides the wet towel is useless and throws it away.
The Brothers Karamazov,77,9,The devil complains about catching a cold while flying through the freezing heavens. But he was fortunately cured by Hoff's extract of malt.
The Brothers Karamazov,77,10,"Ivan rejects all of these anecdotes as stupid. The devil justifies his existence by claiming he exists only to ""negate,"" to create doubt, because if everything was meaningful, there would be no more events."
The Brothers Karamazov,77,11,"He tells the story of a philosopher who all his life denied the existence of an afterlife. Upon his death, he discovered there was an afterlife, but he refused to go to heaven because it went against his convictions. He was then sentenced to walk a quadrillion kilometers as punishment, but since this also went against his convictions, he refused to walk. After a thousand years, he decided, oh heck, I'll walk. Once he got to heaven he sang its praises enthusiastically."
The Brothers Karamazov,77,12,"Ivan again rejects the devil – the anecdote wasn't his, it was a story Ivan made up when he was 17."
The Brothers Karamazov,77,13,"The devil tells another couple of stories: the first is about a man who lost his nose to some dreadful disease. The man complained to his priest that he wanted his nose back, but the priest told him that, hey, at least without your nose you won't have to worry about your nose being ""out of joint"" (i.e., bothered) about its being out of joint (as in, literally broken) ever again."
The Brothers Karamazov,77,14,Pretty punny.
The Brothers Karamazov,77,15,"The second story is about a young floozy who confesses to her priest that she has slept with a man. After her confession, the priest and the floozy set up a booty call."
The Brothers Karamazov,77,16,"Ivan just becomes more and more infuriated by the devil's stupid stories (as are you, no doubt). The devil continues to mock his philosophy and his writings to his face, including the one about the Grand Inquisitor."
The Brothers Karamazov,77,17,"At his wit's end, Ivan throws an inkstand at the devil."
The Brothers Karamazov,77,18,Their conversation is interrupted by a knock at the window. Suddenly Ivan feels as if he's been tied to his chair. He breaks free from what seem to be imaginary bonds and opens the window.
The Brothers Karamazov,77,19,"It's Alyosha, and Ivan lets him in. Alyosha announces that Smerdyakov has hanged himself."
The Brothers Karamazov,76,0,"A blizzard starts up as Ivan heads over to Smerdyakov's. On the way he bumps into a peasant and shoves him violently out of the way. The peasant lies on the ground, unconscious, but Ivan doesn't help – nor does he seem to care that the peasant is dead."
The Brothers Karamazov,76,1,"At Smerdyakov's, Maria informs Ivan that Smerdyakov is quite ill. When Ivan enters, Smerdyakov is laid up in bed, and Ivan notices that his eyes are yellow (a sign of jaundice, perhaps?). Smerdyakov taunts Ivan with the suggestion that they killed Fyodor together."
The Brothers Karamazov,76,2,"When Ivan calls him on it, Smerdyakov pulls out from his sock – bam! – a wad of 3,000 roubles."
The Brothers Karamazov,76,3,Ivan is flabbergasted by the sight of the incriminating evidence.
The Brothers Karamazov,76,4,"Smerdyakov admits that he faked his epileptic fit on the day of the murder. And the money was never under Fyodor's mattress, as everyone, including Dmitri, thought; Smerdyakov had convinced Fyodor to hide it behind the icons."
The Brothers Karamazov,76,5,"Smerdyakov slyly suggests that Ivan is actually the real murderer because he is just a simple servant, while Ivan is the mastermind. Ivan rejects this point and tells Smerdyakov that he's a lot smarter than people give him credit for."
The Brothers Karamazov,76,6,"Smerdyakov had predicted that Dmitri would come out and try to steal the money that night, so when Dmitri finally left after hitting Grigory, Smerdyakov had gone up to Fyodor's window."
The Brothers Karamazov,76,7,"Fyodor had been terrified by Dmitri's visit, so Smerdyakov tricked him into believing that Grushenka was outside, waiting to visit him. When Fyodor opened his window to look, Smerdyakov grabbed a cast-iron inkstand and clopped Fyodor over the head with it. Then he stole the money, leaving the envelope on the floor as if Dmitri had opened it up in a frenzy, and hid the money in the hollow of an apple tree in the yard."
The Brothers Karamazov,76,8,"When Ivan asks Smerdyakov about the gate that Grigory had insisted was open, Smerdyakov smiles and confirms that it was closed; Grigory was simply confused."
The Brothers Karamazov,76,9,"Ivan denounces Smerdyakov and tells him that the two of them are going to reveal everything at Dmitri's trial tomorrow. To Ivan's surprise, Smerdyakov offers him the 3,000 roubles. Ivan tells him this money doesn't change his mind and leaves."
The Brothers Karamazov,76,10,"On the way back, Ivan comes across the unconscious peasant in the road. This time he picks him up and carries him on his back to get some help at a nearby cottage."
The Brothers Karamazov,76,11,"Ivan thinks he might go directly to the commissioner to reveal everything, but then decides to wait until Dmitri's trial for the great revelation."
The Brothers Karamazov,76,12,"Back in his own room, Ivan feels irritable and can't help staring at the empty sofa across from him."
The Brothers Karamazov,49,0,Dmitri dashes into see Fenya to get the scoop on Grushenka. He frightens Fenya and her grandmother because of his bloodied appearance. She confirms that Grushenka is off to Mokroye.
The Brothers Karamazov,49,1,"Dmitri then heads back to his friend Pyotr Ilyich Perkhotin, the young official he'd pawned his pistols to. He pays back the loan and gets his pistols back."
The Brothers Karamazov,49,2,"Perkhotin is startled by how much money Dmitri seems to be flashing around all of a sudden. They send Perkhotin's servant out to the local store for some change, but Dmitri asks Perkhotin's servant to order lots of treats, as Dmitri is planning on wooing Grushenka again in Mokroye."
The Brothers Karamazov,49,3,"Perkhotin helps Dmitri wash off the blood, all the while trying to get the story out of him, but Dmitri incoherently mumbles about gold mines and Madame Khokhlakov and punishment and theft. Still confused, Perkhotin accompanies Dmitri to Plotnikov's store, where Dmitri loads up a cart with goodies and sets off for Mokroye."
The Brothers Karamazov,49,4,"Perkhotin is highly suspicious of Dmitri. He goes to the tavern to take his mind off things, but when he tells everyone about Dmitri's sudden wealth, they wonder if Dmitri's finally gotten around to killing his father."
The Brothers Karamazov,49,5,"This concerns Perkhotin, so he decides to investigate and heads to Grushenka's house to get the story from her servant Fenya."
The Brothers Karamazov,48,0,"Suspicious that Grushenka may have headed off to his father's house, Dmitri goes there. He sneaks into his father's yard over a garden wall."
The Brothers Karamazov,48,1,"From his post outside his father's bedroom window, Dmitri can see Fyodor, all dressed up, his head still in bandages from when Dmitri beat him up. To test whether Grushenka is there, Dmitri gives the secret tapping signal on the window. Fyodor immediately rushes to the window, calling for Grushenka."
The Brothers Karamazov,48,2,The narrative abruptly breaks off with Dmitri pulling the brass pestle from his pocket...and...Grigory wakes up. Suddenly we're seeing things from Grigory's point of view.
The Brothers Karamazov,48,3,"Grigory remembers that the garden gate is still unlocked, so he goes off to lock it. He notices a man running and grabs his leg as the man tries to jump the wall. He feels a blow and falls unconscious."
The Brothers Karamazov,48,4,"The narrative shifts back here to Dmitri's point of view, who throws the pestle onto the grass. Dmitri tries to stop the blood flowing from Grigory's head wound, but gives up and heads straight back to Grushenka's, where a servant's nephew tells him that she headed off to Mokroye a couple of hours ago."
The Brothers Karamazov,92,0,"The end of Fetyukovich's speech is greeted with loud applause from the courtroom. But Kirillovich is indignant and in his hurried response takes Fetyukovich to task for invoking the Gospel, for insulting Kirillovich's use of psychology, and for inventing fantastic and unbelievable explanations for Dmitri's and Smerdyakov's behavior."
The Brothers Karamazov,92,1,Fetyukovich responds to these accusations in a calm and reasonable way.
The Brothers Karamazov,92,2,The judge then asks Dmitri if he has anything to say. Dmitri again stresses his innocence and asks for the mercy of the court.
The Brothers Karamazov,92,3,"The judge then briefly lectures the jury, the jury retires, and the audience in the courtroom discusses the speeches."
The Brothers Karamazov,92,4,"After exactly an hour, the jury returns with a verdict: guilty of all charges, with no extenuating circumstances."
The Brothers Karamazov,92,5,Dmitri cries out and Grushenka screams. Dmitri is taken away. The sentencing is to take place the next day.
The Brothers Karamazov,93,0,"But wait, the novel isn't over yet!"
The Brothers Karamazov,93,1,"It's now five days after Dmitri's trial. Alyosha arrives at the home of Katerina Ivanovna, who is caring for Ivan as he recuperates from his illness."
The Brothers Karamazov,93,2,Katerina can't help confessing her deepest feelings to Alyosha. She reveals that she and Ivan had argued for three days straight before the trial about Ivan's plans to help his brother to escape. Ivan had left her with an envelope with the escape plans just in case something happened to him. She also talks about her feelings of intense guilt over her vengeful outburst at Dmitri's trial.
The Brothers Karamazov,93,3,Alyosha then tells Katerina that he has a special request from Dmitri: he would like to see her before he goes off to serve his sentence in Siberia. Katerina is undecided and Alyosha leaves her.
The Brothers Karamazov,34,0,"Ivan continues to explain his refusal to accept the world that God created by citing the suffering of the most innocent of human beings: small children. He lists for Alyosha examples of horrendous child abuse: a Turk killing a Bulgarian child before its mother; a Swiss named Richard who had a miserable childhood and grew up to kill a man, but eagerly awaited his hanging because he'd meet God, or so he's told; parents who flog their daughter mercilessly, and the public outcry that the parents were even brought before a court; parents who made their daughter sleep in an outhouse all night; and a general who, furious that a kid hurt his dog, ordered his hounds to hunt the kid down and tear him apart."
The Brothers Karamazov,34,1,"After these horrendous examples, Ivan concludes that he could not accept a world founded on the suffering of just one child, and asks Alyosha if he could either. Alyosha agrees, but he then suggests that the world is founded on the suffering of an innocent who did have the right to forgive all wrongs – Jesus Christ."
The Brothers Karamazov,34,2,"Ivan rejects Alyosha's reply and tells Alyosha that he'd like to share a little poem with him, which – get this – he hasn't written, but has memorized."
The Brothers Karamazov,35,0,"Before Ivan dives into his poem, he gives Alyosha a little lecture on literary history. Ivan explains that in the 16th century – which is when the actions of his poem take place – poems and plays were written about holy figures – the Virgin Mary, Christ, angels, even god – coming down to earth and conversing with ordinary people."
The Brothers Karamazov,35,1,"Ivan's own poem is set in 16th century Seville (in the 1500s), at the height of the Spanish Inquisition. It's the day after a particularly bloody massacre where hundreds of heretics were burned at the stake."
The Brothers Karamazov,35,2,"Christ decides to appear, but instead of making a grand entrance, he comes quietly and inconspicuously. (About as inconspicuously as Brad Pitt at your local mall, apparently, because everybody recognizes him.) He doesn't say anything, but he quietly performs miracles – raising a child from the dead, healing the blind – which pretty much gives him away."
The Brothers Karamazov,35,3,"As Christ goes around wowing everyone with his miracles, the Grand Inquisitor, the guy in charge of all the heretic-burning, appears. He demands that Christ be arrested by the guard, and everyone is so frightened by him that they readily comply."
The Brothers Karamazov,35,4,"Later that night, the Grand Inquisitor visits Christ in prison. He recognizes his prisoner as Christ, but, paradoxically for a self-described Catholic, refuses to listen to anything He has to say."
The Brothers Karamazov,35,5,"At this point, Alyosha is extremely puzzled. Alyosha wonders whether the whole poem is supposed to be some kind of joke. Ivan says it's not, and continues on."
The Brothers Karamazov,35,6,"The Grand Inquisitor, according to Ivan, berates Christ for rejecting Satan's three temptations back in the day when Christ was wandering the wilderness. Those three temptations, for those of you fuzzy on the New Testament, were: 1) offer everybody bread and they will follow you; 2) jump off a cliff to prove that you're the Son of God, and people will believe you; and 3) set yourself up as the ruler of the entire earth and use your power to compel people to obey you."
The Brothers Karamazov,35,7,"According to Ivan's Grand Inquisitor, Christ rejected all of these temptations because he wanted man to freely follow him (instead of being won over by bread, dazzled by miracles, or coerced by earthy power)."
The Brothers Karamazov,35,8,"But the Grand Inquisitor claims Christ got it all wrong, because man does not want to be free. Or rather, only a chosen few can endure the terrible gift of freedom; the majority prefer to be led around, told what to do, and essentially be treated like children. Some even choose to accept the gift of freedom, but because they are not strong or clever enough to know what to do with it, they end up setting up reason and science as gods instead."
The Brothers Karamazov,35,9,"Here the Grand Inquisitor lets Christ in on his secret: he is on Satan's side. Out of his concern for mankind, he has deprived them of their freedom by accepting Satan's temptations, the temptations of miracle, mystery, and authority that Christ had rejected in the wilderness."
The Brothers Karamazov,35,10,"But just because the Grand Inquisitor has all the power doesn't mean he's a happy man. He views his power as a horrible burden, which he has to endure because he happens to be one of the chosen few who accept the terrible gift of freedom. He has to lie to the majority in order to deprive them of their horrifying freedom, and this lie, this sin, makes him suffer."
The Brothers Karamazov,35,11,"Alyosha finds Ivan's poem absurd, although he has trouble spelling out his objections coherently."
The Brothers Karamazov,35,12,"He asks Ivan how the poem ends, and Ivan imagines that at the end of the scene, Christ gets up and kisses the Grand Inquisitor on his wrinkly old lips. The Grand Inquisitor then frees Christ and tells him never to return again."
The Brothers Karamazov,35,13,"Alyosha doesn't understand how Ivan could possibly live with such a dismal view of the world. Ivan says he'll rely on the good old ""Karamazov baseness."" Ivan then reproaches Alyosha for judging him so severely, and Alyosha bends over and kisses his brother."
The Brothers Karamazov,35,14,Ivan is immensely pleased by this gesture and takes his leave of Alyosha. Alyosha notices that Ivan is walking with a slight sway and that his right shoulder is lower than his left.
The Brothers Karamazov,35,15,"He then rushes back to Zosima, who is still on his deathbed. Much later, Alyosha will wonder how he forgot about his brother Dmitri so quickly."
The Brothers Karamazov,43,0,"When Alyosha and Rakitin arrive at Grushenka's, they find that she's all dressed up and in a state of excitement, as if she were expecting someone. She tells them she told Dmitri that she was going to spend all day doing accounting with her ""old man,"" Samsonov, but in fact she's waiting around for a very special message."
The Brothers Karamazov,43,1,"She's so excited that she invites herself to sit on Alyosha's lap. Instead of feeling terrified, as he usually is with women, Alyosha finds himself just plain curious."
The Brothers Karamazov,43,2,"Grushenka announces that her ""officer"" is in town. This officer had left her when she was just 17 and married another woman. It seems that now his wife has died and he wants to get back together with Grushenka."
The Brothers Karamazov,43,3,"Grushenka admits that she had thought of seducing Alyosha before because he just seemed so good and made her feel ashamed, but she announces that she just loves him."
The Brothers Karamazov,43,4,"Rakitin remarks that Alyosha is grieving over Zosima's death, and Grushenka jumps off Alyosha's lap in dismay. Alyosha reads this action as her ""saving"" him from lusty thoughts and proof that there is some goodness within her."
The Brothers Karamazov,43,5,"Grushenka tells Alyosha a fable about an old woman whose sole kind deed in life was to give an onion to a beggar woman. Upon her death, the devils threw her into a lake of fire, but her guardian angel appeals to God. God tells the angel that if the old woman did one act of kindness, he would spare her. The angel mentions the onion. God says OK, you can extend an onion to her, and she can hold onto the onion, and you can pull her out of the lake with the onion. But if the onion breaks, she's stuck in the lake of fire. So the angel offers the woman the onion, the woman grabs hold, and the angel pulls. But everyone else in the lake of fire grabs onto the woman. When she tries to shake them off, the onion breaks and she is back in the lake of fire."
The Brothers Karamazov,43,6,"Grushenka tells Alyosha that her non-seduction of him is her one ""onion,"" her one kind act. In fact, she had even offered Rakitin 25 roubles to bring Alyosha to her for just this purpose. She throws Rakitin the money, which Rakitin accepts, although shamefacedly."
The Brothers Karamazov,43,7,"Grushenka is still exploding with emotion, torn between joy that her officer is returning to her and anger that he rejected her in the first place. She even considers bringing a knife to her meeting with him."
The Brothers Karamazov,43,8,The message from her officer finally arrives: he would like to meet her at Mokroye.
The Brothers Karamazov,43,9,Alyosha and Rakitin leave Grushenka's. Rakitin is still annoyed with Alyosha for being so angelic and leaves him. Alyosha walks alone to the monastery.
The Brothers Karamazov,42,0,The narrator explains that Alyosha is feeling all kinds of conflicted emotions about his elder's death.
The Brothers Karamazov,42,1,Rakitin comes across Alyosha in a pine grove between the hermitage and the monastery. He is lying face down on the ground.
The Brothers Karamazov,42,2,"Rakitin goads Alyosha about his feelings about Zosima's death (and the corpse's unseemly rotting). Alyosha dimly feels that he needs to remember something really important about Dmitri, but he can't remember what."
The Brothers Karamazov,42,3,Finally Rakitin convinces Alyosha to peel himself off the ground and join him for a visit to Grushenka's.
The Brothers Karamazov,29,0,"Alyosha heads off for Snegiryov's, but, as he has to pass his brother Dmitri's house on the way, he decides to stop and see if he's around. Dmitri's landlord insists he's not around, so Alyosha continues on his way."
The Brothers Karamazov,29,1,"At Snegiryov's, Alyosha hesitates to introduce himself, but Snegiryov invites him to make himself at home in his humble cottage. Crowded into the room is the rest of Snegiryov's family, including his ill wife and two daughters. When Alyosha mentions the incident with Dmitri, the young boy who bit him earlier emerges from behind a curtain in the corner."
The Brothers Karamazov,29,2,"Alyosha denies that that's what his visit is about, but Snegiryov offers to whip the boy, which appalls Alyosha. Bust as suddenly, Snegiryov refuses and even yells angrily at Alyosha."
The Brothers Karamazov,29,3,"Alyosha tries to calm Snegiryov down by reassuring him that Dmitri will apologize and make amends if necessary. Snegiryov seems calmer and introduces Alyosha to his wife. But his behavior – and his wife's – annoy his children, so Snegiryov recommends that Alyosha follow him outside."
The Brothers Karamazov,28,0,"Alyosha leaves Lise and follows Madame Khokhlakov into the drawing room, where Katerina and Ivan seem to have just finished a conversation."
The Brothers Karamazov,28,1,"Alyosha is struck by Madame Khokhlakov's description of Katerina as loving Dmitri only out of ""strain,"" because he had woken up in the middle of the night uttering that very word."
The Brothers Karamazov,28,2,"Katerina announces that although she is unsure whether she loves Dmitri, she will never leave him, out of a sense of duty. Alyosha notices that Katerina seems to recognize her own pridefulness and feels sorry for her."
The Brothers Karamazov,28,3,"Ivan announces his agreement with Katerina's proposal, but Alyosha detects a note of malice in his words. Ivan then announces that he's leaving for Moscow."
The Brothers Karamazov,28,4,"Katerina seems disconcerted but quickly recovers and expresses how glad she is that Ivan's leaving, because Ivan gets to tell her aunt about all of her and Dmitri's shenanigans."
The Brothers Karamazov,28,5,"Madame Khokhlakov is beside herself with what she views as Katerina and Ivan's irrationality, because she believes they love each other."
The Brothers Karamazov,28,6,"Alyosha is suddenly moved to chide Katerina for being so dramatic and faking her happiness at Ivan's departure. He tells her that he believes she and Dmitri perhaps never loved each other, and that she really loves Ivan."
The Brothers Karamazov,28,7,This drives Katerina into hysterics.
The Brothers Karamazov,28,8,"Ivan is amused and explains to Alyosha that what motivates Katerina isn't love but pride, and that Katerina has only tolerated Ivan's friendship to take revenge on Dmitri. He then leaves the room."
The Brothers Karamazov,28,9,"Katerina is still beside herself, but then offers Alyosha a couple hundred roubles. She asks Alyosha to take them to a retired captain named Snegiryov, whom Dmitri apparently insulted in front of Snegiryov's son. The captain lives in poverty with his wife and children, and Katerina wants to offer the roubles as charity."
The Brothers Karamazov,28,10,Then she abruptly leaves the room.
The Brothers Karamazov,28,11,"Madame Khokhlakov praises Alyosha for his outburst, but Alyosha is utterly chagrined at the havoc he believes he caused. Madame Khokhlakov then runs off to take care of the hysterical Katerina."
The Brothers Karamazov,28,12,"Lise, who is again behind the door to her room, won't let Alyosha open it to see her, but asks him how he became such an ""angel."" Alyosha is just confused and distraught (who could blame him?) and tells her that he has to go."
The Brothers Karamazov,60,0,"First up for interrogation is the innkeeper Trifon Borisich, who insists that although he never actually counted the money, he could see by sight that Dmitri was holding 3,000 roubles."
The Brothers Karamazov,60,1,"He adds that Dmitri even stated that he was going to spend his ""6,000,"" which the interrogators find very interesting because it suggests that Dmitri spent the 3,000 he stole from Katerina and the 3,000 he stole from his father."
The Brothers Karamazov,60,2,"In addition to the peasants, Kalganov and the Poles are interrogated as well. The interrogators find the Poles' story about how Dmitri tried to bribe them for 3,000 roubles further confirmation of his theft."
The Brothers Karamazov,60,3,"After Maximov, the interrogators call in Grushenka, who behaves with solemnity and grace. Dmitri declares to her that he did not murder his father, and Grushenka declares her belief in Dmitri's honesty and innocence."
The Brothers Karamazov,60,4,"By this point, Dmitri is utterly exhausted and falls asleep. He has a dream that he's being driven by a peasant in a cart across the steppes. As they pass through a village, he asks the peasant why everyone is so poor, and why a baby held by one of the impoverished peasant women is crying. He thinks he hears Grushenka telling him that she will stay with him for the rest of her life, then he wakes up."
The Brothers Karamazov,60,5,"Parfenovich holds a transcript before him and asks Dmitri to sign it, which Dmitri does, without reading it."
The Brothers Karamazov,61,0,"Parfenovich then reads Dmitri a ""Resolution,"" which formally places him under arrest. After another long speech declaring his innocence, Dmitri bids farewell and offers his hand to Parfenovich, who rejects it."
The Brothers Karamazov,61,1,"Grushenka says a brief good-bye to Dmitri, this time with none of the hysterics of their other encounters, and she promises to stick by him."
The Brothers Karamazov,61,2,"They load Dmitri into a cart to take him back to town. Just before he leaves, Kalganov pops up and shakes his hand."
The Brothers Karamazov,61,3,"Dmitri leaves, and the scene ends with Kalganov sitting in a corner, crying into his hands."
The Brothers Karamazov,17,0,"Dmitri continues to tell Alyosha about his history with Katerina. After he loans her the money, the family's honor is saved. Then the colonel dies of an illness and Katerina and her sister leave for Moscow. A wealthy aunt takes Katerina under her wing."
The Brothers Karamazov,17,1,"Katerina is able to repay the money to Dmitri and also, in a letter, offers herself in marriage to him. Dmitri sends a letter back, then sends a letter explaining the situation to Ivan. Ivan is living in Moscow at the time, and Dmitri tells him to go see Katerina. There, Dmitri suspects, Ivan fell in love with Katerina. Later Dmitri finally arrives in Moscow, where his engagement with Katerina is celebrated."
The Brothers Karamazov,17,2,"Although Katerina had made him promise to reform, Dmitri is quickly seduced back to his old ways by Grushenka, a foxy babe in their hometown. Grushenka also has her claws in their father, Fyodor."
The Brothers Karamazov,17,3,"Dmitri confesses that the worst of it is that Katerina had entrusted him with 3,000 roubles to send to her sister in Moscow. But instead of sending the money, Dmitri had spent it all partying with Grushenka."
The Brothers Karamazov,17,4,"Dmitri's only hope, as he tells Alyosha, is to repay Katerina so that he's not the absolute lowest scum of the earth. Since he has no money of his own, he asks for Alyosha's help in getting the money and in breaking off his engagement with Katerina."
The Brothers Karamazov,17,5,"But Alyosha's just a poor monk. Where is he supposed to get the money, you ask? From the very same father, Fyodor, who's also in love with Grushenka."
The Brothers Karamazov,17,6,"Smerdyakov has told Dmitri that Fyodor, in an attempt to win over Grushenka, has promised her 3,000 roubles. All she has to do is sneak into his room with a secret knock that only Smerdyakov and Fyodor know. But now Dmitri knows about their little scheme because Smerdyakov has spilled the beans."
The Brothers Karamazov,17,7,"This is why Dmitri has been hiding in their neighbor's garden guzzling cognac. He's waiting for Grushenka, to prevent her tryst with his father."
The Brothers Karamazov,17,8,"On top of all that, Dmitri wants Alyosha to convince their father to give Alyosha the money intended for Grushenka, money Alyosha can then give to Dmitri to give back to Katerina."
The Brothers Karamazov,17,9,Complicated much?
The Brothers Karamazov,16,0,"Dmitri continues to spill the beans to Alyosha, confessing that he's been an unapologetic womanizer for quite a long time. Alyosha unexpectedly replies that he's just like Dmitri; it's just a matter of degree."
The Brothers Karamazov,16,1,"Dmitri then tells Alyosha that he'd like to tell him about his tragedy, the details of which Ivan already knows."
The Brothers Karamazov,16,2,"Back in his lieutenant days, Dmitri had some issues with his colonel. His colonel had had two wives, now deceased, and each wife had given him a daughter. The first daughter, Agafya, was already becoming a spinster at the ripe old age of 24. The second daughter, who happens to be the Katerina Ivanovna that so terrifies Alyosha, was bright and accomplished and quite the social star. While Agafya was on speaking terms with Dmitri, Katerina always treated him with cold contempt."
The Brothers Karamazov,16,3,"Dmitri had just received a large sum of money from their father, Fyodor, when he learned that there were financial irregularities with the way the colonel was handling government money. Dmitri pulled Agafya aside and told her that if the family ever needed money, he would lend it to them, but only if Katerina came by herself to his rooms to ask for the money. Agafya was shocked and dismissed Dmitri's comment."
The Brothers Karamazov,16,4,"As it turns out, the colonel had been loaning the government's money to a friend of his, who usually repaid the money with interest. This time around, though, his friend had not repaid the money. On top of that, a new major was in town, asking questions. The colonel was just about to shoot himself when Agafya, sensing something was amiss and thinking of Dmitri's words, charged in and intervened."
The Brothers Karamazov,16,5,"Dmitri says that he was just about to go out that night when the door opened, and who should it be but Katerina Ivanovna. When she asked for the money, Dmitri suddenly balked at the thought and pretended he was taking back the request. But just as suddenly, filled with intense hatred, he changed his mind and wrote her a check for the sum. She bowed deeply, with her forehead to the ground, and left."
The Brothers Karamazov,85,0,"As in Chapter 6, we just have more of the prosecutor's closing statement in this chapter and not much action."
The Brothers Karamazov,85,1,"The prosecutor rejects the insanity defense. He argues that Dmitri was just deeply resentful of his father, over his inheritance and over their romantic rivalry for Grushenka. (Kirillovich again cites Rakitin to support his depiction of Dmitri's ""Karamazovian"" passion for Grushenka.)"
The Brothers Karamazov,85,2,"As evidence of premeditation, he brings up the fact that Dmitri had shouted about his plans to kill and rob his father for months."
The Brothers Karamazov,85,3,"The prosecutor finally turns to the events of the night of the murder, in which he paints a decidedly more sympathetic picture of Madame Khokhlakov's behavior. He points to Dmitri's grabbing the brass pestle as a further indication of premeditation. He then mocks the idea that Dmitri could have peeked in on his father and turned away without robbing and murdering him in the way that he had raved about for months, especially since he knew about those ""signals."""
The Brothers Karamazov,85,4,"At this point, the prosecutor turns to the topic of Smerdyakov."
The Brothers Karamazov,84,0,"There isn't a whole lot of action over the next four chapters, which are devoted entirely to the prosecutor's speech. The narrator informs us that he seems to be nervous and feverish, and actually dies nine months later of consumption (d'oh). But we'll give you the broad strokes of his argument here."
The Brothers Karamazov,84,1,"First, the prosecutor doesn't address the crime itself, but instead goes on about how Russian morality has declined to the point that society is used to something like the Karamazov affair. He cites a quote from famous Russian writer Nikolai Gogol's novel Dead Souls, a book everyone there is sure to recognize: ""Ah, troika, bird-troika, who invented you!"" The troika, or carriage, serves as a metaphor for Russia as a whole, and he suggests that this Russia-troika is being pulled into insanity by people like the Karamazovs. (Scattered applause here.)"
The Brothers Karamazov,84,2,"Next the prosecutor paints his own psychological profile of all of the Karamazovs, starting with the father, then on to Ivan, Alyosha, and finally Dmitri. Yup, even goody-two-shoes Alyosha is depicted as clutching onto the monastic life as an escape from his deep Karamazovian corruption. A line about Alyosha perhaps sinking either into ""mysticism"" or ""chauvinism"" draws some applause."
The Brothers Karamazov,84,3,"Then the prosecutor goes back to the theme of Russia and states that, actually, ""we are all Karamazovs,"" capable of both high idealism (as seen in Alyosha) and total degradation (as seen in Fyodor). Interestingly, he cites a quote from Rakitin on this point."
The Brothers Karamazov,84,4,"Then Kirillovich suddenly seems to remember that there is a crime to prosecute and says, ""incidentally,"" that he thinks it goes against Dmitri's unstable nature to save and sew up 1,500 roubles in an amulet."
The Brothers Karamazov,84,5,"After dismissing the dispute over Dmitri's inheritance as irrelevant, the prosecutor goes on to the medical opinions about Dmitri's state of mind."
The Brothers Karamazov,23,0,"As night falls, Alyosha hurries back to the monastery. On the road he is suddenly accosted by a man who shouts, ""Your money or your life!"""
The Brothers Karamazov,23,1,"Fortunately it's just Dmitri, who's decided to play a prank on Alyosha. Alyosha chastises him for being so light-hearted, especially given Dmitri's attack on their father earlier that day. Dmitri apologizes and tells his brother he loves him."
The Brothers Karamazov,23,2,"Alyosha then tells Dmitri about Katerina's quarrel with Grushenka. At first Dmitri seems almost enraged, but as soon as he hears about Grushenka's joke on Katerina, he laughs heartily. Alyosha chides Dmitri for taking Katerina's insult so lightly. Chagrined, Dmitri remembers telling Grushenka how moved he was by Katerina's sacrifice for her father, and he thought Grushenka had sympathized with him. Realizing that Grushenka may have been mocking him the entire time, Dmitri denounces himself as a ""scoundrel."""
The Brothers Karamazov,23,3,"Dmitri then tells Alyosha that a ""horrible dishonor is being prepared,"" beating his chest with his fist. Then he runs off without telling Alyosha what the ""horrible dishonor"" is."
The Brothers Karamazov,23,4,"Mystified by his brother's words, Alyosha continues on to the monastery, where the elder Zosima has already gone to bed. Father Paissy greets Alyosha at Zosima's chambers and reminds Alyosha that, despite being out in the world, he is still a novice monk under Zosima's orders and must remember his vows."
The Brothers Karamazov,23,5,"After waiting by Zosima's bed as the elder sleeps, Alyosha returns to the outer chamber, where he takes off his boots to go to bed. He prays before his simple cot. He doesn't ask God for anything (given the dismal world of the novel, it isn't clear God is exactly a receptive guy anyway); he only desires for the ""tenderness"" that comes with prayer."
The Brothers Karamazov,23,6,"In the middle of his prayer, he happens to feel the envelope that Katerina's maid had left in his pocket. After finishing his prayer, he opens the envelope. It's a letter from Lise, the young daughter of Madame Khokhlakov. She professes her love for him but worries that her reputation will be ruined because of her letter. Alyosha laughs with joy as he finishes the letter and passes into a peaceful sleep."
The Brothers Karamazov,22,0,"Troubled by what has just transpired at his father's home, Alyosha heads off to Katerina's, but it's already dusk."
The Brothers Karamazov,22,1,"When he arrives there is some commotion in the drawing room before he is at last shown in. The room is empty, with a tea service set for two, and Alyosha realizes he must have interrupted some company."
The Brothers Karamazov,22,2,"Katerina comes in and greets him warmly. Alyosha gives her Dmitri's message, which Katerina doesn't take as a rejection. Instead, she tells Alyosha that she's convinced that she can save Dmitri from himself by showing what a true friend she can be, even forgiving him for stealing the money that was meant for her sister and spending it on his mistress, Grushenka."
The Brothers Karamazov,22,3,"For who should be visiting Katerina at that moment but...Grushenka! She walks in to the room and greets Alyosha. Katerina gushes that Grushenka is an angel, takes her hand and kisses it. Katerina informs Alyosha that Grushenka has agreed to break it off with Dmitri."
The Brothers Karamazov,22,4,"Grushenka denies that she ever promised any such thing. Katerina is confused, but seems reassured when Grushenka takes her hand to return her kisses. But, laughing, Grushenka changes her mind and refuses to kiss Katerina's hand."
The Brothers Karamazov,22,5,"Realizing that Grushenka has just been toying with her, Katerina almost attacks her but is restrained by Alyosha. She begs Alyosha to leave, and as he does, the maid hands him a note from Madame Khokhlakov."
The Brothers Karamazov,5,0,"Fyodor, Ivan, Pyotr Miusov, and Miusov's distant relative Pyotr Fomich Kalganov arrive at the monastery, but there's no Dmitri in sight."
The Brothers Karamazov,5,1,"They are led to Zosima's hermitage by Maximov, a landowner who happens to be headed in the same direction. On the way, a monk intercepts them and invites them to dinner with the Father Superior later in the day."
The Brothers Karamazov,5,2,"The hermitage is surrounded by beautiful flowers. Outside, the faithful have gathered to wait for Zosima's blessing. A monk asks them to wait while he announces their arrival to Zosima."
The Brothers Karamazov,4,0,"Alyosha's mentor at the monastery is the spiritual figurehead, Zosima. As his elder, Zosima has complete control over Alyosha. The idea is that through obedience to his elder, Alyosha will be able to gain mastery over himself and attain religious illumination."
The Brothers Karamazov,4,1,"Meanwhile, relations between Dmitri and Fyodor have become so bad that Fyodor, half in jest, suggests that they settle it through a meeting with Zosima. Dmitri agrees, and so does his former guardian Pyotr Miusov, who happens to be suing the monastery over a forest. Ivan, who functions as a mediator between Dmitri and Fyodor, is also coming."
The Brothers Karamazov,4,2,"Alyosha is filled with foreboding at the prospect of this meeting, and he's particularly concerned that his father is going to cause another scandal."
The Brothers Karamazov,54,0,"Perkhotin rushes over to the house of Mikhail Makarovich Makarov, the district commissioner of police, where a party is taking place. When he arrives, he discovers that not only are all the important officials there, but they have also already been notified of Fyodor Karamazov's murder by the servant Marfa Ignatievna."
The Brothers Karamazov,54,1,"What happened was this: Marfa is woken up by a terrible scream from Smerdyakov, the kind that always began his epileptic fits. She notices Grigory is missing, then hears groaning from the garden, where she discovers a bloodied Grigory much as Dmitri left him in. She rouses her neighbor, Maria Kondratievna, her daughter, and the visiting Foma, and they all go to Fyodor Karamazov's house, where they discover his dead body. Marfa then runs off to the deputy commissioner's."
The Brothers Karamazov,54,2,"Perkhotin, Makarov, and the other officials head over to Fyodor Karamazov's house to investigate. After surveying the scene, they dispatch the deputy commissioner off to Mokroye to keep watch on Dmitri while they get the paperwork settled for his arrest."
The Brothers Karamazov,54,3,"This is why, when Dmitri had previously met Trifon Borisivetch outside (Book 8, Chapter 8), the innkeeper looked concerned – he had already been notified by the deputy commissioner of Dmitri's impending arrest."
The Brothers Karamazov,55,0,"So now we're back at the inn, where Dmitri has just been accused of his father's murder. Grushenka has to be pulled away from Dmitri. Dmitri is sat at a table, where Parfenovich and Kirillovich begin his interrogation. A clerk takes notes."
The Brothers Karamazov,55,1,"Dmitri is relieved to learn that Grigory is OK, and he denies that he murdered Fyodor. The officials remind him that he's been talking about murdering his father for the last month or so; that he's been loudly protesting that his father owes him his inheritance; and that Dmitri regarded the 3,000 roubles Fyodor was saving for Grushenka as his own property."
The Brothers Karamazov,55,2,"Dmitri concedes all these points, but he still denies murdering his father."
The Brothers Karamazov,55,3,His initial joy and relief at discovering that Grigory is still alive gives way to sadness at his father's death.
The Brothers Karamazov,55,4,Grushenka bursts in to interrupt the interrogation and she has to be taken to a different floor altogether. Makarovich explains to Dmitri that he calmed Grushenka down and placed her in the care of Maximov and the innkeeper's daughters. Dmitri is grateful.
The Brothers Karamazov,30,0,"Snegiryov then starts rambling on to Alyosha about the back-story behind his dispute with Dmitri. He had been some kind of servant to Dmitri but had cheated him on Grushenka's and Fyodor's orders. On discovering this, Dmitri had turned him out of the tavern by his beard, mockingly called the ""whiskbroom,"" in front of his own son and the other children. His son continues to be mocked by the children and is constantly getting into fights with them even though he's frail."
The Brothers Karamazov,30,1,Alyosha then offers him the 200 roubles. Snegiryov seems genuinely grateful and goes on about all the wonderful things he can do for his family.
The Brothers Karamazov,30,2,"But all of a sudden, Snegiryov's mood seems to change. He flings the roubles on the ground and announces that his honor can't be bought. But as he runs away, he also asks Alyosha what his son would say if he knew that he had accepted money from a Karamazov."
The Brothers Karamazov,31,0,"When Alyosha arrives at the Khokhlakovs', Madame Khokhlakov is on her way out the door to tend to Katerina, who is now running a fever."
The Brothers Karamazov,31,1,"Alyosha and Lise are alone, so Alyosha tells Lise about his encounter with Snegiryov. He reveals that he's actually glad that Snegiryov rejected the money because it gave Snegiryov the chance to prove he was an honorable man. Alyosha decides that Snegiryov will be more receptive to the money the next day."
The Brothers Karamazov,31,2,"Lise then tells Alyosha that her note to him actually wasn't a joke at all. Alyosha tells her he knows, and Lise is annoyed because he seems so cold. But then he kisses her, which surprises them both. He confesses that he had her letter in his pocket all along."
The Brothers Karamazov,31,3,"Lise asks Alyosha why he seems so terribly sad, and he mentions how troubled he is by his family's conflicts and Zosima's ill health."
The Brothers Karamazov,31,4,"After kissing Lise good-bye, Alyosha heads downstairs only to be headed off by Madame Khokhlakov, who is distressed by what she's overheard between him and Lise. Alyosha refuses to show her Lise's letter and continues out the door."
The Brothers Karamazov,79,0,"The chapter opens at 10 in the morning the next day, in the courtroom just before Dmitri's trial begins."
The Brothers Karamazov,79,1,"The narrator tells us that the trial has attracted such nationwide attention that the court has made the unprecedented arrangement of setting up a row of chairs for dignitaries by the judges. Women seem in general to favor the romantic Dmitri, whose love triangle with Grushenka and Katerina seems to have struck a chord, and men seem to favor punishing him."
The Brothers Karamazov,79,2,"The famous lawyer Fetyukovich has been brought in to defend Dmitri, while the prosecutor Kirillovich will present the case against him."
The Brothers Karamazov,79,3,"Into the packed courtroom arrives the presiding judge, a second judge, then an honorary justice of the peace, followed immediately by Kirillovich. The jurors are already settled in, although the narrator seems to frown on their composition: four low-ranking officials, two merchants, and six local peasants and townsmen."
The Brothers Karamazov,79,4,"The presiding judge announces the trial of Dmitri Karamazov, and Dmitri appears, followed by his lawyer. A list of witnesses is read, including four who are unable to appear: Miusov, who is in Paris; Madame Khokhlakov and Maximov, who are ill; and finally Smerdyakov, who killed himself the night before."
The Brothers Karamazov,79,5,"It's the first that Dmitri, and the general public, have heard of Smerdyakov's death. Dmitri shouts, ""The dog died like a dog!"" for which the judge quickly reprimands him."
The Brothers Karamazov,79,6,"The judge asks Dmitri how he'll plead, and Dmitri theatrically professes his innocence. The judge again orders Dmitri to cool it."
The Brothers Karamazov,79,7,"The judge orders the trial to begin. The witnesses are led away to their seating area, after being lectured by the priest and the presiding judge."
The Brothers Karamazov,78,0,"Alyosha explains to his brother that Maria Kondratievna had rushed over an hour ago to tell him that Smerdyakov had hanged himself. Alyosha had hurried back to her cottage to discover Smerdyakov still hanging, and a brief suicide note left on the table. Alyosha then went straight to the police commissioner to tell him the news, before arriving at Ivan's."
The Brothers Karamazov,78,1,"Alyosha remarks that Ivan looks ill, and Ivan mysteriously states that he already knew that Smerdyakov had hanged himself. Ivan seems to think it's very significant that the wet towel he had wrapped around his head in the previous chapter is lying folded and unused next to his dressing table."
The Brothers Karamazov,78,2,"Ivan then raves to Alyosha that ""he"" (i.e., the devil of the previous chapter) was here. They had even talked about Smerdyakov's suicide and Ivan's plan to confess his dealings with Smerdyakov at the trial the next day. The devil had scoffed at Ivan's plan as being born of pride, a need for praise for his noble defense of Dmitri."
The Brothers Karamazov,78,3,"Ivan continues to rave about how everyone – Katerina, Lise, even Alyosha – despises him. Over the next two hours he becomes more and more delirious and falls asleep on the couch."
The Brothers Karamazov,78,4,Alyosha lies next to him and prays.
The Brothers Karamazov,47,0,"As we learned in Book 7, Chapter 3, Grushenka told Dmitri that she was off to help Samsonov with his accounts."
The Brothers Karamazov,47,1,"The narrative picks up with Dmitri, who leaves Grushenka and tries desperately to find some money. He pawns off his shooting pistols with a casual friend, a young official in town."
The Brothers Karamazov,47,2,"Dmitri then goes off to visit his father's neighbor, Maria Kondatrievna, where he is distressed to learn that Smerdyakov has fallen ill."
The Brothers Karamazov,47,3,"Dmitri heads home, worried. He washes up, gets dressed, and decides to borrow the 3,000 roubles he needs from Madame Khokhlakov."
The Brothers Karamazov,47,4,"Dmitri arrives at Madame Khokhlakov's, who is, strangely, thrilled to see him. He keeps trying to ask her for the 3,000 roubles, and eventually succeeds – or so he thinks. But Madame Khokhlakov really is just trying to get him to work with the gold mines, where he would, eventually, earn 3,000 roubles. She drapes a small silver icon around his neck as a kind of good-luck charm."
The Brothers Karamazov,47,5,"Dmitri, furious and impatient with Madame Khokhlakov's incoherent plans, bangs his fists on the table, spits, and walks out the door."
The Brothers Karamazov,47,6,"Outside Dmitri dissolves into hopeless tears as he beats himself on a certain spot on his chest, the same spot he had beaten when he talked previously with Alyosha in Book 3, Chapter 11."
The Brothers Karamazov,47,7,"Grief-stricken, he wanders into the square, where he encounters an old woman whom he recognizes as a servant of Samsonov. When he asks her about Grushenka, he discovers that Grushenka had left Samsonov's shortly after he dropped her off."
The Brothers Karamazov,47,8,"Furious, he heads to Grushenka, where he discovers from her servant Fenya that she has just recently left for Mokroye. On the way out, he takes a brass pestle from the table and stuffs it in his pocket."
The Brothers Karamazov,46,0,"Having no money, Dmitri pawns his silver watch for six roubles and borrows three roubles from his landlords. Then off to Ilyinskoye he goes."
The Brothers Karamazov,46,1,"At Ilyinskoye he meets up with the priest Lyagavy is staying with. The priest tells him that Lyagavy – who should be called Gorstkin, since he hates the name Lyagavy – is staying with a forester at Sukhoy Possyolok."
The Brothers Karamazov,46,2,"Upon their arrival at the forester's, they discover that Lyagavy is passed out drunk in his room."
The Brothers Karamazov,46,3,"Unable to wake him, Dmitri decides to wait outside the drunk's room until he wakes up. The priest heads back to Ilyinskoye."
The Brothers Karamazov,46,4,"Dmitri must have fallen asleep, because all of a sudden he wakes up to find the room filled with fumes. The forester helps Dmitri air out the room, but Lyagavy sleeps peacefully on."
The Brothers Karamazov,46,5,"Dmitri again falls asleep outside Lyagavy's room, and the next time he wakes it's 9 in the morning. He finds that Lyagavy has already started drinking heavily again. He tries to engage Lyagavy in conversation, but Lyagavy keeps accusing him of being out to cheat him."
The Brothers Karamazov,46,6,"Realizing that he's been the victim of Samsonov's malicious trickery, Dmitri returns back home and straight to Grushenka's."
The Brothers Karamazov,73,0,"On his way to look for Ivan, Alyosha notes that the lights are on at Katerina's, and figures Ivan must be visiting her. Sure enough, he meets Ivan just as he's leaving Katerina's. They both go up to see her."
The Brothers Karamazov,73,1,"Alyosha tells Katerina that Dmitri doesn't want her to testify, but Katerina scoffs at him. She reveals that she's been to visit Smerdyakov because Ivan has told her that Smerdyakov is the real killer, but she still seems unconvinced."
The Brothers Karamazov,73,2,"When Ivan leaves, Alyosha chases after him and gives him Lise's note. Ivan tears up the letter."
The Brothers Karamazov,73,3,"Ivan then tells Alyosha that he's only staying friendly with Katerina because he doesn't want her to ruin Dmitri's chances at the trial. Ivan claims he's no longer in love with Katerina, but he also believes that Katerina has a document that ""mathematically"" proves that Dmitri killed their father, an idea that Alyosha rejects."
The Brothers Karamazov,73,4,"When Ivan asks Alyosha who he thinks killed their father, Alyosha insists that he doesn't think it was Dmitri. Ivan is strangely disturbed, then accuses Alyosha of spying on him in his room when he was visited by an unnamed man."
The Brothers Karamazov,73,5,Alyosha is completely mystified and denies spying on his brother.
The Brothers Karamazov,73,6,"Ivan tells Alyosha to leave him alone, and they go their separate ways."
The Brothers Karamazov,73,7,"Instead of going home, Ivan decides on impulse to go to Smerdyakov's."
The Brothers Karamazov,72,0,It's already getting quite late when Alyosha finally visits Dmitri in his cell. Rakitin is just on his way out and seems irritated with Alyosha for some reason and can barely look him in the face.
The Brothers Karamazov,72,1,"Dmitri is amused by Rakitin, who wants to make a name for himself by writing an article about Dmitri's trial. Rakitin apparently had big plans for a journalistic career in Petersburg, all funded by Madame Khokhlakov's money. Rakitin wrote that catty article for Rumors because Khokhlakov had rejected him and all his career plans had fallen apart."
The Brothers Karamazov,72,2,"Dmitri believes that over the past two months, sitting in prison, he has felt a ""new man"" arise within himself, and some possibility for redemption is available to him through suffering. Even miserable sinners like himself, stuck in prison, can assume the guilt of everyone else in the world and sing God's praises in a ""tragic hymn."""
The Brothers Karamazov,72,3,"Dmitri tells Alyosha about how annoyed he is at Katerina, who has hired a doctor to prove him mentally ill. He doesn't want her to testify about their humiliating past together, fearing that she will humiliate not only him, but herself."
The Brothers Karamazov,72,4,"But Dmitri is also tempted by a huge ""secret,"" which he finally reveals to be Ivan's plan for his escape. Ivan wants desperately for Dmitri to escape prison and go to America."
The Brothers Karamazov,72,5,Then all of a sudden Dmitri asks Alyosha if he thinks he killed their father. Alyosha swears that he believes Dmitri to be innocent.
The Brothers Karamazov,72,6,"Saddened that his brother could distrust him, Alyosha leaves to find Ivan."
The Brothers Karamazov,27,0,"Alyosha arrives at the Khokhlakovs', bloody finger and all."
The Brothers Karamazov,27,1,"Madame Khokhlakov wants to talk about Zosima's ""miracle,"" but she's also mystified by what she perceives to be her daughter's hysteria. Lise pipes up behind a door that she isn't hysterical at all, but Madame Khokhlakov chides her for driving herself into hysterics."
The Brothers Karamazov,27,2,"Alyosha interrupts this little tiff by asking for a clean cloth for his wounded finger, the sight of which horrifies Lise and Madame Khokhlakov."
The Brothers Karamazov,27,3,"As Lise sends her mother off to get various dressings for Alyosha's wound, she has a moment alone with him. She tells him her love letter was just a joke, and now that she's embarrassed, she'd like it back. Alyosha replies that he left the letter back at the monastery, and besides, he took her letter very seriously and plans to marry her."
The Brothers Karamazov,27,4,"Lise is thrilled, but just then her hysterical mother returns. Lise slyly announces to her mother that Alyosha is planning on getting married, but doesn't reveal that it's to her."
The Brothers Karamazov,27,5,Her mother is just confused and rambles on about rabid schoolboys. Then she announces that Katerina has also arrived and is eager to speak with Alyosha.
The Brothers Karamazov,26,0,"Alyosha then heads off to Madame Khokhlakov's. On a lane to Mikhailovsky Street he encounters a group of boys, all of whom have stones in their hands. He then notices a sickly boy a few feet from them. All of a sudden the sickly boy throws a stone at one of the boys. Before he knows it, Alyosha is also hit on the shoulder by a rock."
The Brothers Karamazov,26,1,"The boys start hurling stones at the sickly boy and Alyosha pleads with them to stop. They insist that the sickly boy attacked one of them first, stabbing a boy with a pen-knife earlier that day."
The Brothers Karamazov,26,2,"Alyosha asks the sickly boy why he's throwing stones. The boy yells at him to leave him alone. As Alyosha turns back, the boy throws another stone at him."
The Brothers Karamazov,26,3,Alyosha asks the boy why he did that and the boy promptly bites him on the finger. Alyosha calmly wraps his bleeding finger in a kerchief and persists in trying to get the boy to talk to him. But the boy breaks out into tears and runs away.
The Brothers Karamazov,50,0,"Dmitri hightails it off to Mokroye. He's eager to meet up with Grushenka, but at the same time he's seriously considering suicide. It doesn't help that the coachman seems to want to have a philosophical chat with him. With the loaded pistol in his pocket, Dmitri appears to plan on suicide at dawn."
The Brothers Karamazov,50,1,"When he arrives at Mokroye, the innkeeper Trifon Borisich is pleased to see him, particularly as Dmitri spent so much money last time he was in town."
The Brothers Karamazov,50,2,"Trifon leads Dmitri to the room where Grushenka, her officer, her officer's friend, and a couple of locals (Kalganov and Maximov) are sitting. Grushenka shrieks in surprise when she sees Dmitri."
The Brothers Karamazov,51,0,Dmitri tells everyone not to be afraid – he just wants to hang out with Grushenka. Grushenka calms down and Maximov entertains everyone with a couple stories about his own stupidity.
The Brothers Karamazov,51,1,"Grushenka gets increasingly irritated with the Poles, who keep speaking to her in Polish."
The Brothers Karamazov,51,2,"At an awkward moment, Dmitri proposes a toast to Russia, to which everyone drinks except the Poles, who then cheer Poland. This irritates Grushenka even more."
The Brothers Karamazov,51,3,Then Maximov proposes a game of cards. Dmitri is losing a lot of money – so much so that Kalganov intervenes and stops him from playing.
The Brothers Karamazov,51,4,"Then Dmitri has a brilliant idea. He invites the Poles to another room, where he proposes to give them 3,000 roubles to leave Grushenka. The Poles seem interested, until Dmitri reveals that he doesn't have all the money on him. Suddenly they stomp out of the room indignantly and denounce Dmitri's behavior."
The Brothers Karamazov,51,5,"Grushenka has had it with the Poles and tells them off. As if on cue, some peasant women begin to sing a dance tune, and the innkeeper himself walks in and tells the Poles to shut up. The innkeeper reveals that the Poles have been cheating at cards all night. Still indignant, the Poles lock themselves up in a room."
The Brothers Karamazov,1,0,"After his mother's death, Dmitri was ignored by his father and sent to live with Grigory, the trusty family servant."
The Brothers Karamazov,1,1,"His mother's cousin, Pyotr Alexandrovic Miusov, happened to return from Paris a year later and rescued Dmitri. But then Pyotr abandoned Dmitri to go to Paris, pawning him off onto his mother's cousin, who then died and passed Dmitri on to one of her daughters."
The Brothers Karamazov,1,2,"Dmitri grew up, led an unruly life, went into the military, and spent way more money than he had."
The Brothers Karamazov,1,3,"He came back to Fyodor's to see what he could get of his inheritance left to him by his mother. Fyodor started off by giving Dmitri some money from time to time over the course of four years. By the end of this time, Dmitri was impatient for the rest of his inheritance, but Fyodor informed him there was no money left. Dmitri wasn't satisfied with this explanation and suspected a scam."
The Brothers Karamazov,0,0,"The novel opens with the narrator telling us that Alexei Fyodorovich Karamazov is the third son of Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov, who died a ""dark and tragic death"" thirteen years ago. Instead of going straight to this juicy bit, though, the narrator decides to go into everything leading up to the death. So buckle your seatbelts, 'cause it's going to take him, oh, several hundred pages."
The Brothers Karamazov,0,1,We learn that Fyodor is the scum of the earth who makes oodles of money and lives a scandalous lifestyle.
The Brothers Karamazov,0,2,"He had his first son, Dmitri, by his first wife, Adelaida Ivanovna Miusov, who came from an aristocratic family and was apparently quite a catch. No one is sure why she eloped with him in the first place, but she ended up abandoning him and their son to run off to Petersburg with a seminarian. She died before Fyodor could chase her there. After her death, Fyodor made a scene around town, drinking, sobbing, and shouting in the streets."
The Brothers Karamazov,19,0,"The conversation turns to an incident Grigory heard in town. A Russian soldier on the borderlands had been caught by the Asians. When he refused to reject Christianity, he was flayed alive."
The Brothers Karamazov,19,1,"Fyodor jokingly remarks that the soldier should be proclaimed a saint and his skin sent to a monastery to be worshipped. Grigory, who is quite devout, frowns."
The Brothers Karamazov,19,2,"Then Fyodor notices that Smerdyakov is smiling and asks him to explain himself. Smerdyakov asserts that if he were in the soldier's shoes, he would have renounced Christianity before the Asians asked him to do so. Then he wouldn't have blasphemed in rejecting God."
The Brothers Karamazov,19,3,"Fyodor loves Smerdyakov's twisted logic, but Grigory is furious. Smerdyakov slyly notes that not even devout Grigory has faith enough to move mountains."
The Brothers Karamazov,19,4,"Fyodor enjoys Smerdyakov's argument as a great example of Russian faith, and he prods Ivan and Alyosha to agree with him."
The Brothers Karamazov,18,0,"When Alyosha enters his father's home, his father and brother Ivan are finishing dinner and the servants attend them in the dining room."
The Brothers Karamazov,18,1,"Here we're given a little background on Smerdyakov, Stinking Lizaveta's son."
The Brothers Karamazov,18,2,"A quiet, sullen child, Smerdyakov was discovered to have the ""falling sickness"" (epilepsy); he would fall into fits every month or so. For some reason Fyodor grew quite fond of the boy after his illness was discovered."
The Brothers Karamazov,18,3,"One day, Smerdyakov was found picking through his soup, and Fyodor decided that Smerdyakov should be trained as a chef. After training in Moscow, Smerdyakov came back to be Fyodor's cook. Now 24, he is just as sullen and silent as ever."
The Brothers Karamazov,64,0,"Kolya steps out onto the market square and whistles for Smurov, a boy a couple years younger than him. Together they head through the square to visit Ilyusha."
The Brothers Karamazov,64,1,"It seems that since the rock throwing incident, Ilyusha has taken seriously ill. Moreover, he keeps calling for a dog named Zhuchka, which no one has been able to find. Since the incident, his classmates have started visiting him regularly, along with Alyosha Karamazov."
The Brothers Karamazov,64,2,"Although Ilyusha has dearly wanted to see Kolya, Kolya has refused to visit him for the entire month until now."
The Brothers Karamazov,64,3,"As the two boys cross the square, Kolya baits the peasants who are out selling their wares."
The Brothers Karamazov,64,4,"Finally they arrive at Ilyusha's, but Kolya asks Smurov to go in and ask Alyosha to meet him outside"
The Brothers Karamazov,65,0,"When Alyosha comes out, Kolya gives him the back story on his relationship with Ilyusha. When Ilyusha first arrived at school, he was picked on by the kids. But Kolya appreciated his fighting spirit and defended him, and Ilyusha took to following Kolya around."
The Brothers Karamazov,65,1,"One day, Smerdyakov told Ilyusha that it would be really cool if he placed a pin in a piece of bread and gave it to a dog. This dog – the same Zhuchka that everyone's searching high and low for – eats the bread and runs off squealing in pain."
The Brothers Karamazov,65,2,"Filled with remorse, Ilyusha breaks down in tears before Kolya. Kolya isn't having any of that ""sentimental slop"" and sends Smurov to tell Ilyusha that he's breaking off their friendship for a short time."
The Brothers Karamazov,65,3,"Without Kolya's protection, Ilyusha is again pestered by the other kids, which led to the stabbing and stone throwing described in Book 4, Chapter 3."
The Brothers Karamazov,81,0,"Next three medical experts are called in to weigh in on Dmitri's state of mind: Dr. Herzenstube, the unnamed famous doctor from Moscow, and the young Dr. Varvinsky."
The Brothers Karamazov,81,1,"Herzenstube goes first. He testifies that he finds Dmitri to be of an ""abnormal"" state of mind. As confirmation, he oddly states that when Dmitri walked into the courtroom, he should have looked to the left where the women were sitting, since he has a thing for the ladies. Instead he looked straight ahead. That's a convincing argument (not)."
The Brothers Karamazov,81,2,"Next up is the famous doctor. He agrees with Dr. Herzenstube that Dmitri is ""abnormal,"" but he adds that Dmitri has ""mania"" and is prone to act in a ""fit of passion."" As if to one-up Herzenstube, the famous doctor claims that Dmitri should have looked to the right when he walked into the courtroom, because that's where his defense attorney was sitting."
The Brothers Karamazov,81,3,"Finally comes Dr. Varvinsky. He testifies that he believes Dmitri to be completely sane and that it was quite natural for him to look straight ahead as he walked, because that's where the judges were sitting."
The Brothers Karamazov,81,4,Dmitri loudly agrees with Dr. Varvinsky.
The Brothers Karamazov,81,5,"Then Dr. Herzenstube is called up again by the defense and surprises everyone with a sympathetic story about Dmitri. Herzenstube remembers coming across Dmitri as a young child, neglected by his father. He had bought Dmitri a pound of nuts out of charity. Years later, when Dmitri returned to town as a young man, he visited Herzenstube and reminded him of his kindness. Dmitri loudly insists again on his gratitude, and everyone in the court seems impressed."
The Brothers Karamazov,80,0,"At this point the witnesses for the prosecution give testimony. The prosecutor seems particularly interested in Dmitri's dispute with his father over his inheritance, while the defense lawyer seems particularly focused on whether anyone has ever actually seen the envelope or not."
The Brothers Karamazov,80,1,"First to give witness is Grigory, who describes his version of the events of that night. Grigory claims to have forgiven Dmitri for attacking him and even calls his father's treatment of him unfair."
The Brothers Karamazov,80,2,"When the defense lawyer asks Grigory if he's ever seen the envelope, Grigory admits he's never seen it."
The Brothers Karamazov,80,3,"The defense lawyer then asks Grigory about the ingredients in the medicinal balm he had used the night of Fyodor's murder, and Grigory reveals that the main ingredient is – vodka. After establishing that Grigory must have been quite drunk and not quite a credible witness on the night of the murder, the defense lawyer rests."
The Brothers Karamazov,80,4,"Dmitri loudly thanks Grigory for being such a great servant, and the judge reprimands him again for his outburst."
The Brothers Karamazov,80,5,"Next is Rakitin, who is allowed to digress from his testimony into eloquent monologues on the evils of serfdom and a Russia in disorder. He even gets applause for his impressive speeches. But the defense lawyer brings up the fact of Rakitin's intimacy with Grushenka, and their bet over Alyosha (Book 7, Chapter 3). Rakitin cannot deny that he never returned the betting money to Grushenka, so he too is discredited."
The Brothers Karamazov,80,6,"The next witness is Captain Snegiryov, who is an utter drunken mess bewailing the imminent death of his young son. He is quickly dismissed."
The Brothers Karamazov,80,7,"After Snegiryov, the innkeeper Trifon Borisovich is called up. Trifon is quite smug on the stand, but the defense lawyer undercuts Trifon by getting him to confess that he stole money from Dmitri on his drunken spree."
The Brothers Karamazov,80,8,"The Poles are next on the list, and they too act noble and superior under the prosecutor's questioning. But Fetyukovich challenges them on cheating at cards, and Kalganov is called up to confirm this. The Poles leave the stand amid general laughter."
The Brothers Karamazov,13,0,"The novel shifts back in time and spends a few pages with Grigory Vasilievich and his wife Marfa, Fyodor's servants. Grigory is a pious man who, as was mentioned before, took care of Fyodor's sons when his wives died."
The Brothers Karamazov,13,1,"Grigory's one child with Marfa was a great disappointment because the child was born with six fingers. Grigory thought the child must be a dragon and only reluctantly had the child baptized. The child died a couple of weeks later, but on the night they buried their child, Marfa woke to hear the cries of a newborn."
The Brothers Karamazov,13,2,"The two of them went out to the bathhouse in the garden, where they discovered the village holy fool, Stinking Lizaveta, who had just given birth to a son."
The Brothers Karamazov,12,0,"While Alyosha was helping Zosima in his cell, Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan proceeded on to the Father Superior's. Miusov had just finished apologizing for Fyodor's behavior when Fyodor popped in. Fyodor had been planning on skipping the lunch, having caused enough commotion already, but in his carriage he had changed his mind and decided he had a couple more tricks up his sleeve."
The Brothers Karamazov,12,1,"Fyodor at first accuses Maximov the landowner of being somebody else – some dude named von Sohn who, according to Fyodor, had died a grotesque death in a brothel."
The Brothers Karamazov,12,2,"Next, Fyodor attacks the Father Superior and the monastery in general. He accuses them of stealing the peasants' money and spending it on lavish spreads like the dinner they're about to enjoy. He also accuses them of turning his second wife, the ""shrieker"" (Ivan and Alyosha's mother) against him."
The Brothers Karamazov,12,3,"During these tirades, the Father Superior's only reaction is to thank Fyodor for giving them all a dose of humility, which Fyodor ignores."
The Brothers Karamazov,12,4,"Miusov can't stand Fyodor's behavior anymore and leaves, followed by Kalganov."
The Brothers Karamazov,12,5,"Fyodor also leaves, demanding that Alyosha leave the monastery as well. Ivan follows Fyodor. As they get into their carriage, the landowner Maximov comes running after, thinking that the real party's with Fyodor. But Ivan pushes him away from the carriage and orders the driver to leave."
The Brothers Karamazov,12,6,"In their carriage, Fyodor tries to get Ivan to talk, but Ivan coldly ignores him."
The Brothers Karamazov,69,0,"Alyosha heads off to visit Grushenka, who is in quite a state. After Mitya's (Mitya is a nickname for Dmitri) arrest, Grushenka was sick for almost five weeks. Now, two months later, she's doing better, although she's lost some weight."
The Brothers Karamazov,69,1,"Incidentally, she has let the old man Maximov stay on with her out of charity, and he entertains her with funny stories."
The Brothers Karamazov,69,2,We learn that the trial is the next day.
The Brothers Karamazov,69,3,"Grushenka has just returned from a visit to Mitya, where they had a terrible argument over Grushenka's former Polish lover. It seems that now the Poles are living in incredible poverty, and Grushenka sends them small sums of money from time to time out of pity. Right before she went to visit Mitya that day, she had stopped by the Poles', where her former lover had tried to seduce her with music. Grushenka thought it was funny; Mitya did not."
The Brothers Karamazov,69,4,"Grushenka has her own cause for jealousy. She believes Mitya is back in love with Katerina, who's hired a fancy Moscow doctor to diagnose Mitya as insane. The thinking here is that since the whole town thinks Mitya is guilty, it might be better to argue that he's insane."
The Brothers Karamazov,69,5,"Ivan, to Alyosha's surprise, has also visited Dmitri, who has told Grushenka that he and Ivan have a secret."
The Brothers Karamazov,69,6,"Alyosha promises to find out their secret for Grushenka, and leaves."
The Brothers Karamazov,68,0,"OK, this is maybe the saddest part of the whole book, so get your Kleenex ready."
The Brothers Karamazov,68,1,"The famous doctor, who obviously thinks he is way too important to visit a poor family like the Snegiryovs, condescendingly states that the only way the family can be saved is if they move – Ilyusha to Sicily, the daughter and the mother to the Caucasus, and the mother to Paris."
The Brothers Karamazov,68,2,"His contempt angers Kolya, who threatens the doctor with an attack from Perezvon, but Alyosha calms Kolya down. Kolya returns to the room and the doctor leaves in a huff."
The Brothers Karamazov,68,3,"Snegiryov tries to reassure Ilyusha, but Ilyusha already knows that nothing can be done and that there's no cure. He pulls both Kolya and Snegiryov to his tiny, consumptive body in a hug."
The Brothers Karamazov,68,4,Everybody is crying at this point. He tells Snegiryov that when he dies – sniff – Snegiryov should find another boy to be friends with – sniff – and just please don't ever forget him – sniff – just visit his grave once in a while.
The Brothers Karamazov,68,5,Sob.
The Brothers Karamazov,68,6,"Kolya can't fight the tears, so he leaves the room. Kolya heads home, and Alyosha leaves as well."
The Brothers Karamazov,20,0,"Fyodor dismisses the servants. He gets more and more drunk on cognac and starts making up stories about Zosima. He asks Ivan why he won't go to Chermashnya as a favor to him, but Ivan continues to refuse."
The Brothers Karamazov,20,1,"Fyodor then tells Alyosha some unsavory stories about his dead mother. After getting through one story about how he spit upon one of her religious icons, Fyodor notices that Alyosha has, all of a sudden, begun to tremble and weep, just as his mother, the ""shrieker,"" used to do."
The Brothers Karamazov,20,2,"Fyodor wonders if he's gone too far, and Ivan savagely reminds him that Alyosha's mother is his mother, too."
The Brothers Karamazov,20,3,"At this point, Dmitri suddenly barges into the room."
The Brothers Karamazov,21,0,"Dmitri runs around the room, shouting that he saw Grushenka headed to the house and he knows she's here. Everyone insists that she couldn't possibly have entered the house without their being aware of it."
The Brothers Karamazov,21,1,"Fyodor accuses Dmitri of stealing the money intended for Grushenka and rushes at him. Dmitri grabs Fyodor by the hair, throws him to the floor, and kicks him. Ivan and Alyosha pull Dmitri away. Finally convinced that Grushenka isn't in the house, Dmitri runs off to look for her. As he leaves, he reminds Alyosha to go see Katerina."
The Brothers Karamazov,21,2,"The servants help Fyodor to bed and Ivan leaves to get some air in the yard. Alyosha goes to his father, who is still out of it from drink and the beating he got from Dmitri. Fyodor tells Alyosha he can have his mother's icon and return to the monastery. He asks Alyosha to see Grushenka, but then takes back his request. He then asks Alyosha to visit him the next day."
The Brothers Karamazov,21,3,"On his way out of the house, Alyosha sees Ivan, who says that he'll protect Fyodor from Dmitri."
The Brothers Karamazov,6,0,"When they enter Zosima's cell, they are joined by two hieromonks (monks who are also priests), the Father Librarian and Father Paissy, as well as another young seminarian. Alyosha walks in at the same time with a novice and Zosima."
The Brothers Karamazov,6,1,"Zosima blesses the hieromonks, but Pyotr Miusov, who considers himself too advanced to believe in religion, politely refuses the blessing. Fyodor mockingly imitates Pyotr."
The Brothers Karamazov,6,2,"Ivan also bows and refuses the blessing. Alyosha blushes, ashamed of their behavior."
The Brothers Karamazov,6,3,"Fyodor goes off on a tangent and tells a silly and untrue story about Diderot. He then asks Zosima how to ""inherit eternal life,"" and Zosima calmly tells him by not lying."
The Brothers Karamazov,6,4,"Fyodor seems to take this advice with good humor, then accuses Miusov of telling him the false story about Diderot. Miusov is confused and wonders whether he did tell the story, but then gets annoyed with Fyodor for mocking him."
The Brothers Karamazov,6,5,"Zosima excuses himself from the gathering to bless the faithful outside, but before he leaves, Fyodor manages to kiss his hand, claiming that he was fooling around just to test him."
The Brothers Karamazov,7,0,"Outside, the first woman Zosima greets is named Nastasia, who was grieving for her dead three-year-old son. Zosima tells her that it's a good thing that she's weeping because it shows what a good mother she is, but she ought to return to her husband and care for him. Nastasia is comforted by his words."
The Brothers Karamazov,7,1,"Next up is a widow whose son Vasenka is serving in the military out in Siberia. She hasn't heard from him in a while and heard a superstition that if she put his name on the church's list of prayers for the dead, he'll contact her. Zosima tells her that would be a sin and to patiently await her son. He further predicts that the son is alive and will either return or send her a message."
The Brothers Karamazov,7,2,"After that, Zosima greets a woman who walked four miles with a baby to see him. She gives him some money to distribute to the poor, and he blesses her and her child."
The Brothers Karamazov,57,0,"Parfenovich and Kirillovich then ask Dmitri about his visit to his father's. Dmitri insists that the gate to the garden was closed, while Parfenovich and Kirillovich insist that it was open."
The Brothers Karamazov,57,1,"Dmitri then tells his interrogators about the secret signals that only he, Smerdyakov, his father, and Grushenka knew, the signals that would announce Grushenka's arrival to Fyodor. Parfenovich suggests that Smerdyakov may have killed his father, but Dmitri rejects this possibility because he believes Smerdyakov is a weak-willed coward."
The Brothers Karamazov,57,2,"The interrogators keep pestering Dmitri, even asking him to demonstrate exactly how he sat on the garden wall when Grigory accosted him. Dmitri tells them about getting his pistols back from Perkhotin, his suicide plans, and even gives them the note he had shown to Perkhotin in Book 8, Chapter 5."
The Brothers Karamazov,57,3,"The interrogators go back to the question of the money. They estimate, given how much money they've found on Dmitri right now (around 800 roubles) and the amount he spent on the festivities, that he had roughly 1,500 roubles on him, not 3,000. Dmitri refuses to tell them how he got the money or why he had claimed previously that he had 3,000 roubles."
The Brothers Karamazov,57,4,They then ask Dmitri to strip so they can search his possessions.
The Brothers Karamazov,56,0,Parfenovich and Kirillovich continue their interrogation.
The Brothers Karamazov,56,1,"Full of good intentions, Dmitri gives a long, rambling, detailed account of the events of the past two days, but the district attorney and the prosecutor aren't too impressed with his candor. They only seem interested in a few questions of fact: how much money he had, how much money he needed, and why he grabbed the brass pestle."
The Brothers Karamazov,63,0,"On this particular Sunday, Kolya is eager to go out, but he's been asked to babysit his neighbor's kids. He shows them a small toy cannon with some shot and makes his dog perform tricks for them."
The Brothers Karamazov,63,1,Finally the servant Agafya returns and Kolya heads out with his dog.
The Brothers Karamazov,62,0,"The novel shifts to the beginning of November, where we are introduced to 14-year-old Kolya Krasotkin."
The Brothers Karamazov,62,1,"Krasotkin is popular among his peers and respected for being a daredevil. In the previous July, he had lain down on some railroad tracks on a dare as a train passed over him. The story spread, and his reputation was sealed – but his widow mother was utterly distraught, so he had to vow never to pull such a dangerous prank again."
The Brothers Karamazov,62,2,"Kolya also has an intellectual streak in him, reading books from his father's library and showing off in class, particularly in Dardenalov's history class. This is in part because Dardenalov has the hots for his mom, which Kolya tolerates."
The Brothers Karamazov,62,3,"Kolya also has a dog, Perezvon, who he picked up a month ago. He keeps the dog in the house, teaching it all kinds of tricks."
The Brothers Karamazov,62,4,"Oh, and Kolya's the kid that got stabbed by the sick boy Ilyusha in Book 4, Chapter 3."
The Brothers Karamazov,14,0,"Stinking Lizaveta was just 20 years old when she gave birth to her son. Her father was an unemployed drunkard who beat her whenever she came home, but generally Stinking Lizaveta wandered around town dressed only in a simple shift, despite the best efforts of the townspeople to clothe her. Simple-minded and mute, Stinking Lizaveta would often sleep outside in random gardens."
The Brothers Karamazov,14,1,"One night, or so the rumors went, Fyodor and some other drunken gentlemen were headed home from the club and found Stinking Lizaveta. One of them asked whether she could ever be considered a woman, and they all laughed, except for Fyodor. The gentlemen encouraged Fyodor to have sex with her, but he refused."
The Brothers Karamazov,14,2,"A few months after this incident, everyone noticed to their shock that Lizaveta was pregnant. While Fyodor denied it, everyone assumed he was the father, a rumor that only seemed confirmed with Lizaveta gave birth in his kitchen garden."
The Brothers Karamazov,14,3,"Grigory and Marfa raised the child as their own, and Fyodor even took a liking to him, naming him Smerdyakov, after his mother's last name. Smerdyakov grew to be a cook in Fyodor's household."
The Brothers Karamazov,15,0,"Alyosha decides to take a shortcut over to Katerina Ivanovna's even though she intimidates him. To get to Katerina's, he has to cut through his father's neighbors' garden. These neighbors are an old woman and her daughter, a former chambermaid used to working in grand homes."
The Brothers Karamazov,15,1,"As Alyosha gets to the garden, he's astonished to see his brother Dmitri inside. Dmitri waves him over. Alyosha asks him why he's whispering, and Dmitri shouts out that he's got a secret. But Dmitri's voice quickly goes down to a whisper again as he asks Alyosha to follow him to a gazebo in the center of the garden."
The Brothers Karamazov,15,2,"In the gazebo, Alyosha notices that Dmitri has been hitting the cognac pretty hard. Dmitri starts to ramble, spouting off a mixture of German and Russian poetry and proclaiming himself to be the lowest, basest sensualist – as only a Karamazov could be."
The Brothers Karamazov,86,0,Now we go into the third part of prosecutor Kirillovich's closing statement.
The Brothers Karamazov,86,1,"Kirillovich rejects the idea that Smerdyakov murdered Fyodor, because there is no factual evidence. He paints Smerdyakov as essentially a coward, fearful of Dmitri's strength and Ivan's newfangled ideas, unable to muster enough guts to do something as extreme as murder. In his retelling of the events of that night, Kirillovich argues that there was no point at which Smerdyakov could have murdered Fyodor."
The Brothers Karamazov,86,2,"Then Kirillovich turns to Smerdyakov's suicide note and argues that the absence of any confession to Fyodor's murder is further proof that Smerdyakov didn't do it. He asserts that if Smerdyakov had really confessed to Ivan the night before, as Ivan claimed, Ivan would have gone straight to the police instead of waiting for the trial. Kirillovich said he had information that Ivan had cashed two 5 percent bank notes for 5,000 roubles each a week ago."
The Brothers Karamazov,86,3,"Kirillovich points to Katerina's letter as further evidence for his version of events. Just as the letter had stated, Dmitri had murdered and robbed his father, leaving the envelope containing the roubles on the floor. This is just how someone who murdered in a fit of passion would act, not caring about leaving key evidence behind."
The Brothers Karamazov,86,4,"He also dismisses the idea that Dmitri could have checked on Grigory after he attacked him, because such an act of compassion isn't consistent with Dmitri's character."
The Brothers Karamazov,87,0,Phew. Now you've made it through Chapters 6 through 8 and have finally arrived at the final part of the prosecutor's closing statement.
The Brothers Karamazov,87,1,"Kirillovich describes the events at Mokroye. He depicts Dmitri as someone who thought his world had ended and his romantic hopes were dashed until he arrived at Mokroye. There, according to Kirillovich, he realized that he still had a chance with Grushenka. Reunited with her, his desire to live is rekindled. The reason the investigators found only 1,500 roubles on him is that he stashed the rest of the money in some secret hole at the inn."
The Brothers Karamazov,87,2,"Kirillovich claims that Dmitri's desire to live fuels his absurd stories during his interrogation at Mokroye. When confronted with the seemingly trivial but (to Kirillovich) damning detail that the gate to his father's house was open, Dmitri desperately came up with the fiction of the amulet and Smerdyakov's murdering his father."
The Brothers Karamazov,87,3,Kirillovich then begs the jury to save Russia and convict Dmitri for the murder of his father.
The Brothers Karamazov,87,4,"His speech (finally) over, Kirillovich leaves the courtroom immediately and nearly faints in the next room. The chapter ends with chatter in the courtroom during a brief, twenty-minute break, before the defense attorney begins his speech."
The Brothers Karamazov,37,0,"When Ivan enters the house, he is too irritated to bother speaking with his father. But during the night, he finds himself oddly compelled to get up and check up on him, and he's not sure why."
The Brothers Karamazov,37,1,"When morning comes, he announces to his father that he is off to Moscow. Fyodor begs Ivan to go to Chermashnya to take care of a business deal. Wondering why everyone wants him to go to Chermashnya, Ivan tells his father he'll consider it."
The Brothers Karamazov,37,2,"On his way out, he blurts out to Smerdyakov that he's off to Chermashnya. Smerdyakov's reply is that it's ""always interesting to talk with an intelligent man."""
The Brothers Karamazov,37,3,"On his way to the train station, Ivan's not sure what Smerdyakov meant by that phrase, but he's really bothered by it. He decides not to go to Chermashnya and to go straight to Moscow instead."
The Brothers Karamazov,37,4,"A couple hours after Ivan leaves, Smerdyakov has a fall and goes into an epileptic fit. Fyodor is concerned because Smerdyakov's been his lookout for both Grushenka and for Dmitri, but he's somewhat reassured because, before his epileptic fit, Smerdyakov had told him that Grushenka would almost certainly arrive that night."
The Brothers Karamazov,36,0,"As Ivan heads back to his father's house, he feels increasingly troubled. When he arrives, he sees Smerdyakov sitting on a bench outside and is suddenly overwhelmed by his intense loathing for him. But despite this, he finds himself sitting down on the bench to talk with Smerdyakov."
The Brothers Karamazov,36,1,"Smerdyakov asks Ivan why he doesn't go to Chermashnya, and Ivan is confused by his question. Smerdyakov then babbles a bit about how concerned he is by the trouble between Dmitri and Fyodor, and how worried he is that Dmitri will kill him for conspiring with Fyodor. He wonders whether he'll get an attack of ""falling sickness"" (epilepsy) the next day."
The Brothers Karamazov,36,2,Ivan thinks Smerdyakov is being absurd because he isn't supposed to be able to predict when his epileptic fits will come on.
The Brothers Karamazov,36,3,"Smerdyakov then worries that he'll be considered Dmitri's accomplice just in case Dmitri does end up killing Fyodor, because he's told Dmitri about the secret signals. If Grushenka arrives to accept Fyodor's money, Smerdyakov and Fyodor have agreed on a special knock to announce her arrival."
The Brothers Karamazov,36,4,"Ivan gets even more irritated, but Smerdyakov continues on to tell him that Grigory, Fyodor's faithful servant, is knocked out from the tonic he takes for his back troubles, and his wife Marfa has taken a sip too. If Smerdyakov does have a fit, there will be no one to prevent Dmitri from attacking Fyodor and stealing his money."
The Brothers Karamazov,36,5,"Ivan wants to know why Smerdyakov is so convinced that Dmitri will kill Fyodor. Smerdyakov says if Grushenka were to seduce Fyodor, she would convince him to sign over their inheritance to her."
The Brothers Karamazov,36,6,"Ivan asks whether that's the real reason Smerdyakov wants Ivan to go to Chermashnya instead of Moscow – Chermashnya is closer just in case Dmitri does commit the murder. Smerdyakov is so irritating at this point that Ivan is about to punch him, but instead he walks away laughing."
The Brothers Karamazov,40,0,"As the title of the chapter suggests, there's precious little action going on here. Instead, the novel lets Zosima gets a couple of things off his chest before he dies. (Oh, was that a spoiler?) We'll give you the broad outlines of his talks here."
The Brothers Karamazov,40,1,"In this section, Zosima asserts that the Russian monk has an important role in the world, despite living in isolation from his fellow man. According to Zosima, it's really everyone else who is isolated: because people are so caught up in worldly desires, they have no interest in making real connections with other people."
The Brothers Karamazov,40,2,"The modern world of reason and science hasn't freed humankind; it has enslaved them to material things, the desire for wealth and earthly power."
The Brothers Karamazov,40,3,"Through a life of humble prayer, the Russian monk is freed from these material needs. Consequently, he can show others the way to true freedom through leading an exemplary life. Moreover, the Russian monk has an intimate connection to the Russian people, who are fundamentally a religious (or Orthodox) people."
The Brothers Karamazov,40,4,"Here, Zosima insists that ""[e]quality is only in man's spiritual dignity,"" and not in superficial distinctions in class. Thus masters and servants ought to be brothers in spirit."
The Brothers Karamazov,40,5,"Case in point, he tells the story of meeting up with Afanasy, the servant he brutally slapped while he was an officer in St. Petersburg, eight years after he left to become a monk. Afanasy warmly welcomes Zosima into his home and even donates money to Zosima for his mission."
The Brothers Karamazov,40,6,"In this section Zosima talks about how prayer is essentially like the 19th century version of Twitter: you can pray for anyone, at any time, even if you don't know them. Conversely, someone out there is comforted by the thought that someone is praying for them, even if they don't know who it is."
The Brothers Karamazov,40,7,"This sense of being connected to everyone in the earthly realm leads to a feeling of connection to the heavenly realm, to God and his higher truth."
The Brothers Karamazov,40,8,Zosima here insists that man cannot judge or be judged by other men because everyone is guilty. It's only by recognizing how guilty we all are that true universal love becomes possible.
The Brothers Karamazov,40,9,"Zosima exhorts his followers to embrace the ecstasy of loving God, even to the point of throwing themselves onto the earth and kissing it."
The Brothers Karamazov,40,10,"Zosima muses that the best part of hell may be physical suffering, because burning in the fires of hell would take your mind off the even greater torment of your spiritual pain, the pain of being without love. But perhaps in sensing this deeper spiritual pain, the condemned would at least have some ""image"" of what love is like, an image they may not have had access to when they were being distracted by worldly pleasures."
The Brothers Karamazov,40,11,"Even suicides – who, according to the Russian Orthodox faith, are condemned to hell – deserve one's pity, and Zosima confesses to praying for suicides even though the religion forbids it."
The Brothers Karamazov,40,12,"At this point, Alyosha's manuscript breaks off, and the narrator gets back to the action. On this last evening, everyone visiting Zosima believes he is getting better. All of a sudden, though, he feels an intense pain in his chest and falls to the floor, kissing the earth and praying. In this position, he dies."
The Brothers Karamazov,40,13,"The chapter ends with the narrator coyly promising that the events that follow are ""strange, disturbing, and bewildering."""
The Brothers Karamazov,41,0,Zosima's corpse is prepared and placed on display in his cell for his wake.
The Brothers Karamazov,41,1,"The monastery is packed with visitors, eager to witness some miracle surrounding the death of the famous elder. Father Paissy notices two faces in the crowd that bother him, though he doesn't know why: the Obdorsk monk and Rakitin."
The Brothers Karamazov,41,2,"Then outside he comes across Alyosha, weeping by the grave of another monk buried in a corner of the hermitage."
The Brothers Karamazov,41,3,Father Paissy takes his place by Zosima's coffin and begins to read from the Gospels. In the middle of the afternoon a noticeable odor emerges from the coffin. This wouldn't be
The Brothers Karamazov,41,4,"so weird – Zosima is dead, after all – except that there were great expectations that Zosima's body would not decay, as saints of old did not."
The Brothers Karamazov,41,5,"As the news spreads, all of a sudden Father Ferapont, Zosima's nemesis, appears in Zosima's cell. He runs around, claiming to be casting devils out of the cell. Father Paissy sternly rebukes Ferapont and drives him out of the cell."
The Brothers Karamazov,41,6,"But the damage is done. The other monks and visitors murmur their approval of Ferapont, and Paissy is saddened to see Alyosha scurrying away with a weird expression on his face."
The Brothers Karamazov,74,0,"At this point, the novel backtracks a couple months to the time of Dmitri's arrest. Ivan, you might remember, was far from the fray in Moscow and only got the message about his father's death four days after it all happened. On his first day back in town, he met with Dmitri, then he went to visit Smerdyakov."
The Brothers Karamazov,74,1,"Smerdyakov was laid up in the hospital, very ill after a series of epileptic seizures. Ivan confronted him about a number of things Smerdyakov had said before Ivan left for Moscow. Did Smerdyakov fake a seizure? Why did he want Ivan to go to Chermashnya?"
The Brothers Karamazov,74,2,"In his usual sly way, Smerdyakov seems to have an explanation for everything, but he still implies that they're somehow complicit in their father's death – or at least that's what Ivan reads into Smerdyakov's promise that he won't tell the police about their conversation."
The Brothers Karamazov,74,3,"On his return Ivan had also become madly in love with Katerina, although he denied it to Alyosha."
The Brothers Karamazov,74,4,"Two weeks after his return, he confronted Alyosha about whether he thinks he might have wished their father dead. Alyosha reluctantly agrees. After this conversation, Ivan decides to visit Smerdyakov again."
The Brothers Karamazov,75,0,"By the time of Ivan's second visit, Smerdyakov is holed up with Maria Kondratievna, who is now his fiancée. In contrast to the first visit, Smerdyakov seems quite well, and he seems to be studying when Ivan walks in on him."
The Brothers Karamazov,75,1,"Ivan again confronts Smerdyakov, this time about Smerdyakov's suggestion that he won't tell the authorities about the ""whole"" of their conversation."
The Brothers Karamazov,75,2,"This time Smerdyakov is at his most direct and accuses Ivan of being as good as responsible for their father's murder. If Ivan suspected Smerdyakov of planning their father's murder, he did nothing to prevent it or to protect him, making him indirectly guilty."
The Brothers Karamazov,75,3,"Ivan goes so far as to punch Smerdyakov in the shoulder, but when he leaves, he's crazed with doubt and guilt."
The Brothers Karamazov,75,4,"He goes straight to Katerina's and tells her about his conversation with Smerdyakov. She pulls out a letter from Dmitri, which Dmitri had written after Katerina's encounter with Grushenka (Book 3, Chapter 10). In this letter Dmitri vowed that if he was unable to find someone to loan him 3,000 roubles, he would kill his father and steal the money from him."
The Brothers Karamazov,75,5,"This letter reassures Ivan and calms his fears. And yet, perhaps because he sees some truth in Smerdyakov's sly suggestion that he wants Dmitri convicted so he can have more of his father's inheritance, he visits Dmitri ten days before his trial and offers him 30,000 roubles toward his escape."
The Brothers Karamazov,75,6,"Finally the novel catches up to the present moment. Surprised that Katerina had been to visit Smerdyakov, Ivan decides to visit him a third time."
The Brothers Karamazov,91,0,"Now Fetyukovich entertains the idea that Dmitri might have killed Fyodor. Even if he had, according to Fetyukovich, it wouldn't even count as parricide because of what a miserable father Fyodor was. Not only did Fyodor's awful parenting result in the mess that Dmitri is today, but Fyodor so completely abandoned his obligations as a father that he doesn't deserve to be called a father at all."
The Brothers Karamazov,91,1,"Fetyukovich then digresses into a general discussion of how the future of society depends on good fathers. Citing the Gospel, he asks the jury to have mercy on Dmitri and declare him innocent. By this show of mercy, they will be giving Dmitri a chance at redemption and at living a good life, a chance his father never gave him."
The Brothers Karamazov,91,2,"Fetyukovich is frequently interrupted by applause. He ends his speech not with a runaway troika, as Kirillovich did, but with the image of a magnificent Russian chariot."
The Brothers Karamazov,90,0,"In this portion of his speech, Fetyukovich sets out to establish a plausible explanation for Smerdyakov as Fyodor's murderer."
The Brothers Karamazov,90,1,"After dismissing Grigory's testimony (a little too much vodka), Fetyukovich proceeds to tell the court about his own impressions on meeting Smerdyakov. In contrast to the prosecutor's description of Smerdyakov as a weak, bullied man, Fetyukovich paints a picture of him as a wily, spiteful man who knew exactly what he was doing when he set up Dmitri."
The Brothers Karamazov,90,2,Fetyukovich then points out that Smerdyakov had plenty of time to commit Fyodor's murder between the time Dmitri attacked Grigory and the time Grigory fully recovered consciousness.
The Brothers Karamazov,90,3,"At this point Fetyukovich takes on a ""heartfelt"" voice, in contrast to the calm, sensible way he had proceeded thus far."
