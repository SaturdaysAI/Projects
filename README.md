# SaturdaysAI Projects

SaturdaysAI is a global initiative that empowers individuals to learn and apply artificial intelligence through a hands-on, community-driven approach. Our programs offer an opportunity for participants to develop AI solutions to real-world challenges, fostering innovation and collaboration.

This repository serves as the main hub for all SaturdaysAI projects, resources, and contributions. Here, you can find AI projects developed by students from different cities and editions, along with documentation, learning materials, and updates about our community.
