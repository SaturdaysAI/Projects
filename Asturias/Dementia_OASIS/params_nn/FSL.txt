image_type:FSL_SEG #Type of MRI measurement  (FSL_SEG, T88_111,RAW, etc.) 
image_number:1 #number of measurement (1 for everything except RAW), RAW 1-3
patience_validation:1 #how long does it wait if validation los doesn't decrease
patience_plateau:0 #how many times it runs the NN to get out of local minima (uses patience validation)
delta_min:0.1 #minimal validation loss change
batch_size:30 #number of ids to train simultaneously (don't increase or decrease too much) parameters ara minimized each batch
split_size:0.8 # 80% of data to train, 3/4 of left to test, 1/4 of left to validation

max_loss_reset:1 #if NN running loss doesn't decrease past this level, it resets all weights of layers and runs it again
learning_rate:0.00008 #learning rate of the NN, should be around 1E-4 - 1E-5
weight_decay:0.03 #decreases weigths of previous training runs, (forgets the previous batches, good for getting out of local minima)
first_conv_outchann:12 # number of channels outputting from the first convolutional layer (transformations)
second_conv_outchann:24 # number of channels outputting from the secondconvolutional layer (transformations)
fclayer1:210 #number of neurons in the first linear fully connected layer (the basic NN)
fclayer2:None # If not None applies an extra relu function to increase nonlinearity
criterion_type:BCElogitsloss # BCElogitsloss is the probability outputting criterion, CrossEntropyLoss is the categories (0 or 1) outputting criterion
#Changes some neural network architecture and also might give different results. CrossEntropy kept for backwards compatibility
optimizer:Adam #The optimizer to use, does nothing right now
