# Skin Lesions Project

This project is related to the analysis and classification of skin lesions. The main file is a **Jupyter Notebook** titled `mpox_project.ipynb`, which contains the methods and code developed for working with images of skin lesions.

## Project Status

Upon reviewing the repository, it appears that the project is incomplete or was uploaded incorrectly. The `mpox_project.ipynb` file references files that are missing in this repository, suggesting that the original development was done in **Google Colab** with files stored on the developers' **Google Drive**. However, when the project was uploaded to GitHub, these files were not included.

## What is Needed to Complete the Project?

To properly run this project, the following steps are required:

1. **Obtain the Missing Files**: The notebook relies on data files and possibly pre-trained models that are not present in this repository. These files should be obtained, likely from the developers' Google Drive.
   
2. **Update File Paths**: Once the missing files are obtained, the paths in the notebook should be updated to point to the correct locations.

## How to Run the Notebook?

Although the project is incomplete, if you have access to the missing files, you can run the notebook as follows:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd <PROJECT_NAME>
    ```

2. Open the `mpox_project.ipynb` file in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.

3. Make sure you have the required data files (skin lesion images, models, etc.) and update the file paths in the notebook.

4. Run the cells in the notebook to perform the analysis.
