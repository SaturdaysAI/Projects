# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-learning


Diabetes prediction using machine learning involves using data and machine learning algorithms to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes or not. It is a task of binary classification, where the goal is to determine if a person belongs to the "diabetic" or "non-diabetic" class based on a set of input features.



## Let's Build a model with graphical user interface to make it easier to user.


we'll use different algorithms and metric of accuracy which will determine for us which is the best model that we should use.
