# SaturdaysAI Final Project

## Sentinel 2 Dataset Image Classification


We classified Copenhagen Denmark into four classes - Water, Urban, Forest and Farmland
------------------------------

In this project we connected Python with GEE API - ee <br>
Here we called the aunticator and initiater to connect GEE with python- ee.Aunthenticate() ; ee.Initializer()

Then we collected dataset from GEE and worked on classification and confusion matrix 
In the last but not least we calculated accuracy 

The process will be going on untill we get the right result
