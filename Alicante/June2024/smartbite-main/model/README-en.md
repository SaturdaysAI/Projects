# About the Model

## Evaluation

After running the `scripts/evaluate.py` script, we obtain the following values:

### Test Loss: 0.9252066016197205

#### What does it mean?
Loss is a measure that represents the model's error in the prediction task.

#### How to interpret it:
A lower loss value generally indicates better model performance, as it means the error is smaller.

#### Importance:
Loss is used during training to adjust the model parameters and reduce error. In the validation phase, it helps to understand how well the model is performing with new data it hasn't seen before (test data).

### Test Accuracy: (83.26%) 0.8325544595718384

#### What does it mean?
Accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions made by the model compared to the total number of predictions. It is a measure of how often the model is correct.

#### How to interpret it:
In this case, an accuracy of 83.26% means that out of every 100 predictions made by the model, approximately 83 are correct. This indicates that the model is performing quite well, as it is correct most of the time.

#### Importance:
Accuracy is an important metric to understand the effectiveness of the model, especially in classification problems.
