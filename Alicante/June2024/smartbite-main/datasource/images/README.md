# Food101 dataset

## Why am I not seeing the content of `images` folder?

The Food101 dataset consists of pictures of 101 types of food. Each folder corresponds to a type of food, and contains 1000 pictures for each folder. This dataset takes up to ~5GB of memory, so in order to make this repository lighter, we didn't include them. However, this dataset can be downloaded directly from Kaggle.

### IMPORTANT NOTE: 
**The dataset is not necessary for the model to run. Use it only if your plan is training the model by yourself.**

## Content of the dataset
This is the Food 101 dataset, available from: 
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/food-101

It contains images of food organized by type of food. 
It was used in the Paper "Food-101 â€“ Mining Discriminative Components with Random Forests" by Lukas Bossard, Matthieu Guillaumin and Luc Van Gool. 

It's a good (and large) dataset for testing computer vision techniques.
