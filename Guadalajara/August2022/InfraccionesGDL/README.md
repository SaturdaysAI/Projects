### Saturdays.ai - Guadalajara - 4th Edition 


The number of traffic violations in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area has increased year after year. The objective of the business is to seek to reduce the number of infractions by predicting the type of infraction with which it is possible to be penalized in the ZMG in 2023, using different characteristic parameters of the vehicle, where it is sought that the Ministry of Mobility reviews the places with the highest incidences to establish means and create solutions to reduce the incidence of these administrative faults, where, since in 2021, more than 156 thousand infractions of 11 different types were registered:

* Type 1: Bypass the parking meter fee.
* Type 2: Invading two or more parking spaces.
* Type 3: Obstruct a garage.
* Type 4: Parking at an intersection or on a yellow line.
* Type 5: Parking in exclusive places, firefighters, police, medical services or people with disabilities.
* Type 6: Cord or battery.
* Type 7: Immobilized vehicle.
* Type 8: For insulting or verbally assaulting a road officer.
* Type 9: Due to vehicle abandonment.
* Type 10: Exceeding time in the loading and unloading spaces.
* Type 11: Physically assaulting a traffic officer.


The lack of parking spaces and the lack of knowledge of digital parking meters cause the large number of violations registered year after year in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area. This project seeks to help the Ministry of Mobility of the state of Jalisco, in addition to evaluating trends in road compliance and its link with public policy strategies, all of this, focused on seeking to reduce the number of infractions that each year increases more and more.

As a functional prototype deployment, it was decided to make a Dashboard so that the two main markets, motorists and road agents, can consult the historical information from 2021 to August 2022 of the infractions. In this dashboard you can first find general information about the team that developed it, where you can also see the Saturdays AI logo as a header, followed by a short description of the problem that this project sought to solve. Next, the three types of infractions that were used as targets for this model are seen, and the explanation of each of the infractions that are applied in the ZMG, which can be filtered in the following 4 main Dashboard graphs: Top 50 Violated Vehicle Makes, Top 10 Violated Vehicle License Plate Status, Number of Violations by Day of Week, and Number of Violations by Hour of Day. And finally, there is an interactive map where each of the more than 305,000 infractions that have been registered through the city's system is geographically registered. As mentioned before, this dashboard can be of great help to motorists to locate the areas where skip fare infractions are regularly applied, thus seeking to improve driver education and implement good practices to avoid not paying a parking meter, or also locate the areas where they are normally infracted for parking in places where it is not allowed and thus avoid doing so. On the other hand, road agents and the corresponding secretariat can locate these areas where there is a lack of parking for motorists and thus be able to reach joint solutions and achieve a better road culture. This dashboard is available at the following link: https://infraccionesgdl.herokuapp.com/
